strategic_context:
  problem_statement: 'Knowledge workers spend 19% of their workweek (roughly 1 day per week) searching for internal information,
    according to McKinsey research. Traditional keyword search fails to understand user intent, returning results based on
    literal string matching rather than semantic meaning. Users must try multiple query variations, refine with filters, and
    manually sift through irrelevant results. This is especially problematic when searching across diverse document types
    (PDFs, emails, presentations, spreadsheets) where terminology varies. Questions like "What are our customer retention
    strategies?" require understanding that "retention" relates to "churn reduction" and "loyalty programs"—connections keyword
    search cannot make. The result is duplicated work as teams can''t find existing analysis, missed insights as relevant
    information remains undiscovered, and frustration as search becomes a time sink rather than productivity tool.

    '
  market_context: 'Semantic search powered by transformer models and vector embeddings has become mainstream with the success
    of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google''s language models. Enterprise search vendors (Elastic, Algolia, Pinecone) have added
    vector search capabilities to traditional text search, enabling hybrid approaches combining keyword precision with semantic
    understanding. The semantic search market is projected to grow from $1.8B in 2023 to $6.2B by 2028 (28% CAGR), driven
    by demand for AI-powered workplace productivity tools. Key differentiation opportunities include: query intent understanding
    (understanding what users really want to find), result explanation (showing why results are relevant), and search personalization
    (learning from user behavior). The challenge is balancing semantic relevance with traditional factors like recency, popularity,
    and access frequency—users want intelligent search but also predictable, controllable results.

    measurement: Analysis of search session logs tracking query variations and time between queries
definition:
  job_to_be_done: When knowledge workers need to find information to complete their work, they want to search using natural
    questions and concepts, so they can quickly discover relevant content regardless of exact terminology used in documents.
  solution_approach: The Semantic Search & Query Interface uses transformer-based language models to encode user queries and
    document content into vector embeddings capturing semantic meaning. When users submit queries, the system performs hybrid
    search combining vector similarity (finding semantically related content) with traditional keyword matching (finding exact
    mentions). Results are ranked using a learned-to-rank model trained on user behavior signals (clicks, dwell time, sharing).
    The interface provides faceted filtering (by document type, date, project, author), search suggestions as users type,
    and result explanations showing why each document is relevant. Query intent classification detects whether users want
    definitions, procedures, examples, or people expertise, adapting result presentation accordingly.

    name: Natural Language Question Search
    jtbd_category: small_frequent
    actor: Rachel Kim, Management Consultant
    context: Starting research phase of new client engagement focused on retail digital transformation
    trigger: Rachel needs to find internal case studies and frameworks for retail omnichannel strategy, but doesn't know exact
      terminology used in past projects
    action: 'Rachel types natural question in search bar: ''What strategies have worked for retail companies combining online
      and in-store experiences?'' The system interprets her intent as searching for retail omnichannel/unified commerce content.
      Vector search finds semantically similar documents even when they use different terminology. Results show 12 documents
      ranked by relevance with explanations. Rachel clicks top 3 results, reviews content, and saves query as ''Retail Omnichannel
      Research'' for future reuse.'
    outcome: Rachel finds exactly the frameworks and case studies she needs in 5 minutes vs 6-8 hours with keyword search.
      The semantic understanding bridges terminology gaps (her 'combining online and in-store' query matches documents about
      'unified commerce' and 'cross-channel retail'). She discovers 2 highly relevant case studies from 3 years ago that would
      have never appeared in keyword search because they used different terms. She completes research phase 90% faster, spending
      saved time on analysis and strategy development instead of document hunting.
    acceptance_criteria:
    - Search accepts natural language questions of 5-20 words and returns relevant results
    - Results include documents using different terminology but semantically related to query concepts
    - Each result shows explanation of why it's relevant (highlighted matching concepts)
    - Relevance ranking prioritizes documents with highest semantic similarity and metadata signals (recency, popularity)
    - Users can save queries with custom names for quick re-execution from search history

    name: Faceted Filtering to Narrow Results
    jtbd_category: medium_regular
    actor: Dr. Sarah Thompson, Clinical Researcher
    context: Conducting systematic literature review of treatment efficacy studies for rare genetic disorder
    trigger: Initial semantic search returns 200 papers including reviews, case reports, and clinical trials—Sarah needs only
      randomized controlled trials from last 5 years
    action: 'Sarah submits broad query: ''treatment efficacy for lysosomal storage disorders''. Results page shows 200 documents
      with faceted filters on left sidebar: Document Type (showing counts: Research Papers 150, Reviews 30, Guidelines 20),
      Study Type (RCT 45, Observational 60, Case Report 40), Date Range (Last Year 25, Last 5 Years 85, Older 90). She clicks
      ''RCT'' and ''Last 5 Years'' filters. Result count updates to 32 papers matching both criteria. She sorts by citation
      count descending to prioritize influential studies.'
    outcome: Sarah refines 200 results to 32 highly relevant RCTs in 30 seconds using faceted filters. She exports this refined
      result set as BibTeX for reference management. The facet counts helped her understand result composition before filtering
      (knowing 45 RCTs exist gave her confidence in search coverage). She saves this filter combination as 'High-Quality Recent
      Trials' preset she reuses weekly for different disorder searches. Her literature review time reduced from 40-50 hours
      to 15-20 hours, with higher confidence in completeness.
    acceptance_criteria:
    - Faceted filters show counts updating in real-time as filters applied/removed
    - 'Common facets available: document type, date range, author, project/workspace, custom metadata fields'
    - Users can combine multiple facets (AND logic) and exclude facet values (NOT logic)

    actor: Tom Anderson, Sales Engineer
    context: On customer call where prospect asks technical question requiring immediate answer
    trigger: 'Prospect asks: ''Does your product support SAML 2.0 single sign-on with Azure Active Directory?'' Tom needs
      answer within 60 seconds to maintain conversation flow'
    action: 'While on call, Tom types in search bar: ''Azure Active Directory SAML authentication''. Search intent classifier
      detects this as informational query seeking technical facts. Results page shows ''Quick Answer'' card at top with extracted
      answer: ''Yes, supports SAML 2.0 with Azure AD. Configuration requires 3 steps...'' with source document link. Below
      quick answer, related results show detailed technical docs, case studies, and demo videos. Tom reads quick answer aloud
      to prospect and follows up with email containing source documentation link.'
    outcome: Tom answers prospect's technical question in 30 seconds instead of promising to follow up after the call. Immediate,
      confident answer builds trust and maintains sales momentum. The quick answer feature saved Tom from reading through
      full documentation to extract the specific fact. He's able to handle 3x more technical questions during customer calls,
      reducing follow-up emails and accelerating sales cycles by 25%. His ability to provide instant technical responses has
      become a competitive advantage in sales demos.
    acceptance_criteria:
    - Query intent classification detects informational queries seeking specific facts
    - Quick Answer card displays at top of results page with extracted answer text (2-4 sentences)

      multiple interconnected policies'
    action: 'Jennifer searches: ''extended international remote work policy''. Top result is main remote work policy doc.
      Result page shows ''Related Content'' sidebar with semantically similar documents: visa/immigration guidelines, international
      tax considerations, travel expense policies, equipment shipping procedures, and country-specific restrictions. Each
      related doc shows explanation of relationship (e.g., ''This document discusses tax implications (related to international
      work arrangements in your query)''). Jennifer clicks through 5 related documents to build complete understanding.'
    outcome: Jennifer provides comprehensive answer covering all policy dimensions in 10 minutes vs 30-45 minutes manually
      searching each topic separately. The related content feature revealed relevant policies she wouldn't have thought to
      search for explicitly (equipment shipping, country-specific restrictions). She compiles the 5 related documents into
      a single response email with clear guidance. Employee is impressed by thoroughness. Jennifer saves this multi-document
      answer as internal knowledge base article titled 'Extended International Remote Work Guide', helping future employees
      with similar questions.
    acceptance_criteria:
    - Related Content sidebar appears on result page showing 3-10 semantically similar documents
    - Each related document includes explanation of semantic relationship to query
    - Related content ranked by semantic similarity and filtered by relevance threshold (>70% similarity)

    name: Search Result Feedback Improves Ranking
    jtbd_category: continuous
    actor: Tom Anderson, Sales Engineer (representing all users)
    context: Ongoing search usage across organization generating implicit and explicit feedback signals
    trigger: Users click search results, spend time reading documents, share results, and provide thumbs up/down feedback
      on relevance
    action: Tom searches 'API rate limits' and clicks 3rd result (API documentation). He reads for 5 minutes, scrolls through
      document, and shares link with sales team via Slack. He gives thumbs up feedback. Next user searching 'API rate limits'
      sees this document ranked higher (moved from 3rd to 2nd position) due to Tom's positive engagement signals. After 100
      users with similar engagement patterns, the document becomes top result. Users providing thumbs down on irrelevant results
      cause ranking adjustments in opposite direction.
    outcome: Search ranking continuously improves based on user behavior, becoming more accurate over time. Popular, high-quality
      documents surface to top positions organically through user engagement. Irrelevant results drop in rankings after negative
      feedback. The system learns organization-specific terminology and preferences (e.g., that 'API rate limits' queries
      should prioritize technical docs over sales presentations). After 3 months, search success rate improves from 45% to
      75% as ranking model learns from collective user wisdom. Users trust search more as they see result quality steadily
      improving.
    acceptance_criteria:
    - 'System tracks user engagement signals: clicks, dwell time (time spent reading), sharing, return-to-search rate'
    - Ranking model incorporates feedback signals using learning-to-rank algorithm trained on user behavior
    - Model updates run nightly, incorporating previous day's feedback into ranking weights
    - Users can provide explicit feedback (thumbs up/down) on individual results
    - Analytics dashboard shows search quality metrics over time (success rate, average dwell time, query reformulation rate)
  dependencies:
    requires:
    - id: fd-001
      reason: Requires document content and extracted entities from Document Ingestion Pipeline (fd-001) as source material
        for search indexing. Search cannot function without documents to search through. The ingestion pipeline provides document
        text, metadata, and extracted entities that become searchable content and facets.
      name: Feature fd-001
    - id: fd-002
      reason: Integrates with Knowledge Graph Engine (fd-002) to augment search results with relationship context. When search
        returns entity mentions, the graph provides related entities and relationship explanations. Graph-aware search can
        answer questions like 'What projects does this person work on?' by combining text search with graph traversal.
      name: Feature fd-002
    enables:
    - id: fd-004
      reason: Provides semantic search capabilities that improve LLM Processing Pipeline (fd-004) context retrieval. When
        LLMs need relevant information to answer questions, semantic search retrieves the most pertinent documents. This enables
        accurate, grounded LLM responses rather than hallucinated answers.

  risks:
    technical:
    - risk: Vector embedding model drift causing relevance degradation over time
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: Implement embedding model versioning with side-by-side A/B testing of new models before full deployment.
        Monitor relevance metrics (click-through rate, dwell time) continuously to detect degradation. Maintain ability to
        roll back to previous embedding model if new model underperforms. Consider fine-tuning embeddings on organization-specific
        content for domain adaptation.
    - risk: Latency issues with vector search as index grows beyond 10M documents
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: Use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms (HNSW, IVF) optimized for sub-100ms query latency. Implement
        index sharding by organization/project for smaller search scopes. Cache frequent queries and popular documents for
        instant results. Use hybrid search with keyword pre-filtering to reduce vector search candidate set size. Load test
        with production-scale indexes before launch.
    - risk: Semantic search returns conceptually related but contextually wrong results
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: Combine semantic search with keyword matching (hybrid search) to balance semantic flexibility with precision.
        Implement result explanation showing why results are relevant, allowing users to judge context appropriateness. Provide
        explicit negative feedback mechanisms (thumbs down, 'Not relevant' button) to identify and demote poor results. Use
        query intent classification to adjust semantic vs keyword weighting based on query type.
    business:
    - risk: Users frustrated by 'too many results' or 'irrelevant results' from semantic flexibility
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: 'Implement progressive disclosure: show top 10 highly relevant results with option to ''Show more'' if unsatisfied.
        Provide clear sorting/filtering options so users can narrow results predictably. Use result clustering to group similar
        results and reduce perceived volume. Include tutorial/onboarding explaining how semantic search works and how to refine
        queries effectively. A/B test result page designs to optimize for user satisfaction.'
    - risk: Semantic search 'black box' nature reduces user trust compared to predictable keyword search
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: Implement comprehensive result explanations showing why each document is relevant (matching concepts, entities,
        semantic similarity scores). Provide 'Show keyword matches' toggle allowing users to see traditional keyword-based
        results as comparison. Include confidence scores and relevance indicators ('Highly relevant', 'Somewhat related',
        'Tangentially related'). Offer training sessions and documentation explaining semantic search benefits with concrete
        examples.
  compliance:
    regulatory_requirements:
    - 'GDPR Article 15: Search results must respect data subject access request (DSAR) boundaries. When users search for personal
      information about individuals, results should only include documents the searcher is authorized to access, not all documents
      mentioning that person.'
    - 'SOC 2 Type II: Search query logging must capture what users searched for, which results they accessed, and when, for
      security audit purposes. Query logs retained per retention policy (minimum 90 days). Implement anomaly detection for
      unusual search patterns indicating data exfiltration attempts.'
    data_privacy:
    - Search indexing must exclude explicitly marked sensitive fields (SSN, credit card numbers, health records identifiers)
      from searchable content. Implement data masking for sensitive content in search snippets.
    - Search result snippets must not expose sensitive information in preview text. Apply content filtering rules to snippets
      displaying on results page, only showing sensitive content after user clicks through to full document (permission-gated).
    security_standards:
    - Vector embeddings stored in vector database must use encryption at rest. Search query audit logs encrypted and access-controlled.
      API keys for search endpoint rotated every 90 days for service accounts.
    - 'Search API rate limiting prevents bulk scraping and reconnaissance attacks. Implement progressive rate limiting: 1000
      queries/hour for normal usage, temporary blocking after suspicious patterns detected.'
  notes:
    implementation_considerations:
    - 'Embedding model selection: sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) provides good balance of speed and quality for
      English content. OpenAI ada-002 offers higher quality but requires API costs and latency considerations. Consider domain-specific
      fine-tuning for technical/legal/medical content with specialized vocabulary.'
    - 'Vector database evaluation: Pinecone offers managed service with minimal ops overhead but higher costs. Weaviate provides
      open-source option with Kubernetes deployment. PostgreSQL pgvector extension enables vector search within existing database,
      simplifying architecture but with performance tradeoffs at scale.'
    - 'Hybrid search weighting: Start with 50/50 vector-keyword balance, then adjust based on user feedback and A/B testing.
      Informational queries benefit from higher vector weighting (70/30), while navigational queries need higher keyword weighting
      (30/70).'
    user_experience_priorities:
    - Search-as-you-type suggestions should appear within 200ms of keystroke for responsive feel. Use debouncing (300ms delay)
      and request cancellation to avoid overwhelming backend with partial queries.
    - Result explanations should be concise (1-2 sentences) and jargon-free. Avoid technical terms like 'vector similarity'
      or 'BM25 score'—instead say 'semantically related to your query' or 'exact keyword match'. Show explanations on hover
      or expandable sections to avoid cluttering result cards.
    - 'Empty result states should be educational, not dead ends. When search returns zero results, suggest: trying broader
      terms, checking spelling, removing filters, or browsing related topics. Show popular searches and recent activity to
      give users exploration starting points.'
    future_enhancements:
    - Personalized search ranking based on user's role, past search history, and document interaction patterns. Documents
      user previously found helpful should rank higher in future searches. Implement collaborative filtering to surface documents
      popular among similar users (same role/team).
    - Multi-modal search supporting image queries, document upload for similarity search, and audio transcription search.
      Users could upload an image and find documents containing similar diagrams or search using voice queries.
    - Federated search across external data sources (Google Drive, SharePoint, Confluence) with unified result ranking. Provide
      single search interface querying multiple systems, with result deduplication and cross-system relevance scoring.
    - 'Search analytics dashboard for administrators showing: popular queries, zero-result queries, average search session
      duration, search success rate trends. Use analytics to identify gaps in content coverage and optimize search quality.'

    current_situation: As the administrator responsible for managing semantic search & query interface, I face constant challenges
      with system configuration, user support, and operational monitoring. I lack visibility into how the system is being

      time that could be spent on strategic initiatives. When users encounter problems, I often struggle to diagnose root
      causes quickly. The current management tools feel inadequate for enterprise needs.
    transformation_moment: When comprehensive administrative capabilities were added to semantic search & query interface,
      my role transformed from reactive firefighting to proactive system optimization. I gained real-time visibility into
      system health, usage patterns, and potential issues before they impact users. Configuration tasks that once took hours
      now take minutes through automation and intelligent defaults. Troubleshooting became straightforward with detailed diagnostic
      tools and audit logs. I could finally manage the system strategically instead of just keeping it running.
    emotional_resolution: I feel in control and professionally competent in my administrative role. The stress of unexpected
      failures and user complaints has diminished dramatically because I can prevent problems proactively. I have time to
      focus on strategic improvements like security hardening, performance optimization, and user training instead of constant
      firefighting. My reputation as a reliable administrator has grown, and I can confidently present system metrics to leadership.
      The job is now fulfilling instead of overwhelming.
