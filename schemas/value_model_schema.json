  "description": "Defines the hierarchical structure of value delivered through four core tracks: Product (what we build), Strategy (how we compete/grow), OrgOps (how we operate internally), and Commercial (how we monetize/sell). Each track decomposes value into L1 layers, L2 components, and L3 sub-components with clear activation status, premium flags, and value propositions.",
  "$comment": "VALUE MODEL ARCHITECTURE: This schema models the complete value delivery hierarchy across the four fundamental tracks every organization must manage: (1) Product—the capabilities we build for customers (features, experiences, platforms), (2) Strategy—how we compete, position, and grow (GTM, partnerships, market expansion), (3) OrgOps—how we operate and scale internally (team structure, processes, tooling, culture), (4) Commercial—how we monetize and sell (pricing, packaging, sales motions, success programs). Each track follows a three-level decomposition: L1 Layers (major value themes, 5-10 per track), L2 Components (functional groupings, 3-8 per layer), L3 Sub-components (specific capabilities/features, granular units of work). This hierarchical structure enables: Portfolio planning (visualize full value landscape), Prioritization (understand dependencies and sequencing), Communication (align teams on what we're building and why), Roadmapping (plan releases by value layer), Investment tracking (resource allocation across tracks), Premium/tiering (identify paid vs free value). Design principles: (1) Mutual exclusivity (each capability belongs to exactly one track/layer/component), (2) Completeness (model captures all value delivered, not just product features), (3) Actionability (L3 sub-components are concrete, implementable units), (4) Stability (L1/L2 rarely change; L3 evolves frequently), (5) Customer-facing (describe value in customer terms, not internal jargon). Common usage patterns: Product portfolio management (track what's active vs planned), Feature gating (premium flags drive access control), Roadmap planning (sequence sub-components by layer/component), Competitive positioning (identify gaps in value model vs competitors), Sales enablement (link features to value props for pitches), Customer success (track which value customers have activated). Examples: Product track (L1: Core Platform, L2: Data Management, L3: CSV Import, Excel Sync, API Connectors), Strategy track (L1: Market Expansion, L2: Enterprise GTM, L3: Solution Selling Motion, Account-Based Marketing, Executive Engagement Program), OrgOps track (L1: Engineering Excellence, L2: Developer Experience, L3: Local Dev Environment, CI/CD Pipeline, Observability Stack), Commercial track (L1: Monetization, L2: Pricing & Packaging, L3: Usage-Based Pricing, Enterprise Plan, Self-Serve Tier). Best practices: (1) Start with customer value, not implementation, (2) Keep L1 stable (foundational themes rarely change), (3) Evolve L2 as strategy shifts (components emerge/consolidate), (4) Manage L3 actively (features ship, deprecate, get promoted), (5) Link L3 to roadmap (every sub-component maps to initiatives), (6) Use activation status (active/planned/deprecated lifecycle), (7) Mark premium explicitly (avoid confusion on what's paid), (8) Version models (track evolution over time), (9) Validate completeness (walk sales conversations, ensure all value claims are modeled), (10) Review quarterly (value models should reflect current state and near-term plans). Anti-patterns to avoid: Modeling implementation details instead of customer value, L1/L2 that are too granular (should be strategic themes, not features), Missing entire value categories (e.g., no OrgOps or Strategy track), Premium flags without corresponding packaging strategy, Sub-components that are too abstract (should be shippable units), Models that diverge from roadmap reality.",

Examples: Product track layers (Core Platform, Data & Analytics, Collaboration, Integrations, Mobile Experience), Strategy track layers (Market Expansion, Competitive Positioning, Partnership Ecosystem, Brand & Community), OrgOps track layers (Engineering Excellence, Data Operations, Security & Compliance, Team Enablement), Commercial track layers (Monetization, Sales Operations, Customer Success, Partner Programs).",
      "$comment": "L1 LAYER DESIGN: Layers are the foundational structure of your value model—they define the major 'buckets' of value your organization delivers. A well-designed layer structure is: (1) Stable (layers rarely change, even as features evolve), (2) Mutually exclusive (clear boundaries, no overlap between layers), (3) Collectively exhaustive (together, layers cover all value delivered in this track), (4) Strategic (layers map to business priorities and investment themes), (5) Customer-resonant (even internal tracks should have customer-facing impact). Design principles: (a) Start with customer value or business outcomes, not org structure (layers should reflect what customers/business get, not how teams are organized), (b) Aim for 5-10 layers per track (fewer = too broad to be useful, more = too granular to be strategic), (c) Use noun phrases describing value themes (e.g., 'Data & Analytics', 'Engineering Excellence', 'Market Expansion'), (d) Ensure layers have long shelf life (shouldn't need to change quarterly), (e) Consider dependencies and natural sequences (some layers are foundational, others build on top). Common layer archetypes: (Product) Core Platform (foundational capabilities everyone uses), Add-on Capabilities (specialized features for specific use cases), User Experience (cross-functional UX improvements), Developer Experience (platform extensibility), Scale & Performance (enterprise readiness). (Strategy) Market Expansion (new segments/geos), Competitive Defense (matching/beating competitors), Category Creation (defining new markets), Partnership Ecosystem (joint value with partners). (OrgOps) Team Enablement (tools/processes for productivity), Operational Excellence (efficiency/quality), Culture & People (team health/growth), Infrastructure & Security (foundational systems). (Commercial) Monetization (pricing/packaging), Sales Enablement (tools/content for sales), Customer Success (adoption/retention programs), Partner Programs (channel/reseller motions). Layer evolution: Layers typically evolve through three phases: (1) Emergence (new layer identified as strategic priority, initially has few components), (2) Growth (layer fills out with components and sub-components as investment increases), (3) Maturity (layer is well-defined, components are stable, focus shifts to optimization). Rarely should layers be removed—if a layer is no longer strategic, mark its status as deprecated rather than deleting (preserves historical context). Examples: Product track for SaaS CRM (Layers: Core CRM, Sales Automation, Marketing Automation, Customer Service, Analytics & Reporting, Mobile & Collaboration, Integrations & APIs, Platform & Extensibility), Strategy track (Layers: Enterprise GTM, SMB Acquisition, Product-Led Growth, Strategic Partnerships, International Expansion, Brand & Community), OrgOps track (Layers: Engineering Systems, Data & Analytics Operations, Security & Compliance, People & Culture, Finance & Operations), Commercial track (Layers: Pricing & Packaging, Sales Operations, Customer Success Operations, Channel & Partnerships).",

Design principles: (a) Group by customer workflow or job-to-be-done (not by technical architecture), (b) Aim for 3-8 components per layer (balance detail with manageability), (c) Use noun phrases describing functional areas (e.g., 'Data Management', 'User Authentication', 'Reporting & Analytics'), (d) Ensure components have clear boundaries (avoid overlap, ensure every sub-component has obvious home), (e) Consider natural feature clusters (features that ship together or are used together should be in same component). Common component patterns: (Product) By workflow (Onboarding, Daily Operations, Reporting), by user role (Admin Features, End-User Features, Developer Features), by functional domain (Data, Workflow, Collaboration). (Strategy) By go-to-market motion (Enterprise Sales, Product-Led Growth, Channel Partnerships), by market segment (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise), by geographic region (North America, EMEA, APAC). (OrgOps) By operational area (Engineering, Data, Security, People), by capability type (Processes, Tools, Culture), by team/function (Platform Team, Product Team, Data Team). (Commercial) By revenue motion (New Sales, Expansion, Renewals), by customer lifecycle stage (Acquisition, Activation, Retention), by channel (Direct Sales, Channel Partners, Self-Serve). Component evolution: Components are added when: new functional areas emerge (e.g., 'AI Features' component when AI becomes strategic), existing components become too large (split 'Reports' into 'Standard Reports' and 'Custom Analytics'), new use cases require distinct grouping (e.g., 'Mobile-Specific Features' when mobile becomes priority). Components are removed when: features are deprecated and component becomes empty, areas consolidate (merge 'Basic Reports' and 'Advanced Reports' into 'Reporting'), strategic shifts render them obsolete.

Design principles: (a) Keep granularity appropriate for planning (not too small—'Add button'—not too large—'Complete redesign'), (b) Make sub-components customer-facing in description (even for internal features, describe the impact), (c) Ensure independence (sub-component can be shipped without requiring others in same batch), (d) Use action-oriented names (describe what users can do, not just what exists), (e) Link to value props (each sub-component should map to customer benefits). Sub-component attributes: (1) Active flag (is this currently available/built?), (2) Premium flag (is this paid/gated?), (3) UVP (unique value proposition—how does this help customers?), (4) ID (stable reference), (5) Name (customer-facing label). Sub-component lifecycle: Start as 'active: false' (planned/on roadmap), move to 'active: true' when shipped and available, eventually deprecate (remove or mark inactive) when sunset. Premium designation determines: feature gating, sales positioning, packaging/pricing strategy, competitive differentiation. Common sub-component patterns: (Product) Feature-level (CSV Import, Advanced Filters, Real-Time Sync, Customizable Dashboards, Bulk Actions, Email Templates, Mobile App, API Rate Limiting), capability-level (Single Sign-On, Role-Based Permissions, Audit Logs, Webhooks, White-Labeling), experience-level (Onboarding Wizard, In-App Help, Keyboard Shortcuts, Dark Mode). (Strategy) Program-level (Executive Engagement Program, Solution Selling Playbook, Account-Based Marketing Campaign, Competitive Battle Cards), initiative-level (EMEA Market Entry, Vertical Go-to-Market, Strategic Partnership with {Partner}, Category Creation Campaign).
