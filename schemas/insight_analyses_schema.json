  "$comment": "Insight analyses document research and intelligence gathering that precedes opportunity definition. Purpose: Create shared understanding of market context, competitive landscape, user needs, and strategic positioning before committing to specific opportunities. Use this schema during INSIGHT phase to synthesize research from multiple sources (customer conversations, market reports, competitive intelligence, analytics, user research) into structured insights that guide opportunity selection. Key sections: (1) Trends - external forces shaping the opportunity space (technology, market, user behavior, regulatory, competitive), (2) Market Definition - TAM/SAM/SOM sizing and segmentation, (3) Competitive Landscape - who we compete with and how we differentiate, (4) SWOT - internal strengths/weaknesses and external opportunities/threats, (5) User/Problem Research - target segments and problem/solution hypotheses. This is a living document: Update quarterly or when major market shifts occur. Track confidence levels for each section. Review before each planning cycle. Use insights to generate and validate opportunities in insight_opportunity_schema.json. Integration with EPF: Analyses feed into opportunity identification → opportunities feed into feature definitions → features feed into delivery plans. Quality over quantity: Better to have 5 well-researched insights than 50 superficial observations. Ground insights in evidence, cite sources, acknowledge uncertainty.",

Characteristics: Primary research completed, competitive analysis up-to-date, market sizing from credible sources, user interviews representative. Use for: Green-lighting strategic bets, committing significant resources. Medium confidence: Some evidence gaps, research aging, partial coverage, directional but not conclusive. Characteristics: Mix of primary and secondary research, some sections incomplete, competitive intel from public sources only, user research from subset of target segments. Use for: Exploratory opportunities, validation experiments, incremental investments. Low confidence: Weak evidence, outdated research, incomplete coverage, speculative assumptions. Characteristics: Mostly secondary research, competitive intel from press releases, no direct user research, market sizing from rough estimates. Use for: Research priorities, hypothesis formation only - do not commit significant resources. Confidence informs decisions: High confidence + high value opportunity → proceed to NAVIGATE. Low confidence + high value opportunity → invest in research first. High confidence + low value opportunity → pass. Track confidence over time: Does research investment increase confidence?

Set next review based on: Market volatility (fast markets need frequent review), Active opportunities (analyses driving decisions need fresh data), Research quality (low confidence analyses need sooner review). Review triggers: Scheduled date arrives, Major market event occurs, Opportunity validation contradicts analyses, Competitive landscape shifts. Review process: Check if trends still hold, Update competitive intelligence, Validate market sizing, Refresh user research, Adjust confidence levels, Document changes.

Good trend analysis: Identifies clear direction not just observations, Connects trends to opportunity implications, Provides evidence not just opinions, Assesses timing (is this trend accelerating or decelerating), Evaluates impact (which opportunities does this affect).

      "$comment": "Market dynamics reveal WHY the market is evolving in certain directions and WHERE the energy is flowing. They're not static facts—they're forces in motion that create or destroy opportunity. Common dynamics: **Consolidation** (buyers preferring integrated suites over point solutions → harder for new entrants, incumbents gain), **Unbundling** (specialized tools beating all-in-one → opportunity for focused products), **Democratization** (capabilities moving downmarket → mass market opportunity, margin pressure), **Consumerization** (consumer UX expectations bleeding into enterprise → legacy vendors vulnerable), **Platformization** (ecosystems forming around central platforms → need integration strategy or become the platform), **Verticalization** (horizontal tools specializing by industry → compete on domain expertise), **Horizontal expansion** (vertical tools going cross-industry → risk dilution of focus). Good dynamics answer: What's changing? Why is it changing? Who benefits/loses? How fast is it happening? Strategic implications answer: Should we ride this wave or fight it? Does this open or close our opportunity? What capabilities do we need? Example: Dynamic: 'Knowledge work tools consolidating around Slack/Teams as central hubs (70% of teams now use one as primary workspace)' → Implication: 'We must integrate deeply with both platforms or risk becoming peripheral; standalone tools face friction'. Use this to understand timing (riding vs fighting trends), positioning (align with or differentiate from trends), capability priorities (what must we build to leverage dynamics).",

      "$comment": "White spaces are strategic gold—they reveal where you can win without fighting existing competitors head-on. They emerge from several sources: **Underserved segments** (groups ignored by incumbents—too small, too demanding, wrong fit for existing business models), **Unmet jobs** (tasks customers want done but no one solves well—workarounds indicate latent demand), **Overserved needs** (existing solutions too complex/expensive for many buyers—opening for simpler/cheaper alternatives), **Adjacent problems** (related needs that arise before/after current solutions—expand job scope), **Integration gaps** (friction between tools—opportunity to connect or consolidate), **Emerging use cases** (new workflows enabled by tech shifts—first-mover advantage). Good white space identification: **Gap**: What's missing or underserved? Be specific about the customer segment, job, or context. **Evidence**: How do you know this gap exists? Workarounds used, complaints heard, money being spent on substitutes, market research, user interviews. Multiple evidence points = stronger signal. **Opportunity potential**: How big could this be? Consider: How many customers have this need? How valuable is solving it? How much are they spending on alternatives? How quickly could we capture it?
