They document WHY the organization exists (Purpose), WHERE it's headed (Vision), WHAT it does (Mission), HOW it operates (Values), and WHAT IT BELIEVES (Core Beliefs). North Star is foundational - it doesn't change with quarterly plans or feature priorities. Use North Star to: (1) Align strategy decisions - does this opportunity serve our purpose? (2) Evaluate trade-offs - which value takes priority? (3) Test beliefs - is the market evolving as we expected? (4) Onboard leaders - what makes us different? North Star is living - update when pivots occur, but don't chase trends. Tools can validate internal consistency (does mission serve purpose?) and track evolution over time.",
