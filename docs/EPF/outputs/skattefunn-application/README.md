# SkatteFUNN Application Generator

This output generator creates Norwegian R&D Tax Deduction (SkatteFUNN) applications from EPF data.

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate Application

Follow the wizard to generate a complete SkatteFUNN application:

```bash
# Read the wizard instructions
cat docs/EPF/outputs/skattefunn-application/wizard.instructions.md

# Follow Phase 0-5 to generate application
# Output: docs/EPF/_instances/{product}/outputs/skattefunn-application/{product}-skattefunn-application-{date}.md
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** The wizard includes a **MANDATORY interactive selection phase (Phase 0.5)** where you choose which R&D Key Results to include in the application. Do NOT skip this step!

### 2. Validate Application

```bash
bash docs/EPF/outputs/skattefunn-application/validator.sh \
  docs/EPF/_instances/emergent/outputs/skattefunn-application/emergent-skattefunn-application-2025-12-31.md
```

### 3. Fix Issues

The validator will identify:
- **Errors** (must fix): Schema violations, missing sections, placeholder text, budget math errors
- **Warnings** (review): Budget allocations outside typical ranges, missing best practices

### 4. Submit Application

Once validation passes, review the application and submit via:
- **Research Council Portal:** https://kunde.forskningsradet.no/
- **SkatteFUNN Email:** skattefunn@forskningsradet.no
- **Phone:** +47 22 03 70 00

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `wizard.instructions.md` | Complete instructions for generating applications (1,868 lines) |
| `validator.sh` | Validation script checking structure, semantics, budget, traceability |
| `schema.json` | JSON Schema defining input parameters |
| `template.md` | Base template structure |
| `README.md` | This file |

## Validation Layers

The validator performs 4 layers of checks:

### Layer 1: Schema Structure
- 8 required sections present (Project Owner & Roles, About Project, Background & Company Activities, Primary Objective & Innovation, R&D Content, Project Summary, Work Packages, Total Budget & Tax Deduction)
- EPF Traceability section present
- Application metadata complete
- Organization number format (9 digits)
- Character limits enforced (60, 100, 500, 1000, 2000 chars)

### Layer 2: Semantic Rules
- No placeholder text (XXX, [TODO], [TBD])
- All R&D activity fields present
- TRL ranges eligible (TRL 2-7 only)
- Technical uncertainty language present
- Work packages have 2-8 activities each

### Layer 3: Budget Validation
- Budget organized by work packages (1-8 WPs required)
- Each WP has 2-8 activities with allocated budgets
- Cost codes used: Personnel, Equipment, Other Operating Costs, Overhead
- Yearly budgets ≤ 25M NOK
- Budget sums by year and work package reconcile to total
- Work Package budgets reconcile to total

### Layer 4: Traceability
- Roadmap KR references (kr-p-XXX format)
- At least 5 distinct R&D activities
- Direct WP → KR mappings
- Required EPF sources referenced

## Exit Codes

- `0` - Valid, ready for submission
- `1` - Invalid (errors found, must fix)
- `2` - File not found
- `3` - Warnings only (review recommended)

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Treat warnings as errors (strict mode)
VALIDATION_STRICT=true bash validator.sh application.md

# Custom budget limit per year (default: 25M NOK)
VALIDATION_MAX_BUDGET_YEAR=25000000 bash validator.sh application.md

# Budget reconciliation tolerance (default: 1,000 NOK)
VALIDATION_BUDGET_TOLERANCE=1000 bash validator.sh application.md
```

## Common Issues

### Error: Character limit exceeded

**Problem:** Field exceeds official form character limit (e.g., project_summary > 1000 chars)

**Fix:** Trim text to fit within limits:
- Titles (English, Norwegian): 100 chars
- Short name: 60 chars
- Primary objective: 1000 chars
- Project summary: 1000 chars
- Company activities, background, differentiation, R&D content: 2000 chars
- WP challenges, activity descriptions: 500 chars

### Error: Found placeholder text: XXX

**Problem:** Phone number placeholder not replaced: `+47 XXX XX XXX`

**Fix:** Update Section 1 (Project Owner and Roles) with actual phone number:
```markdown
| Nikolai Fasting | Project Leader | Eyedea AS | nikolai@eyedea.no | +47 123 45 678 | ...
```

### Error: TRL 8 or TRL 9 found

**Problem:** SkatteFUNN only covers R&D phase (TRL 2-7), not production (TRL 8-9)

**Fix:** Remove production/operations activities or reframe as R&D challenges with technical uncertainty

### Error: Work Package budgets don't match total

**Problem:** Individual activity budgets don't sum correctly to WP totals or total application budget

**Fix:**
1. Verify each activity's `Allocated Budget` field
2. Sum activities per Work Package
3. Ensure WP totals sum to total application budget
4. Check for rounding errors (tolerance: 1,000 NOK)

### Warning: Cost code outside typical range

**Problem:** Cost allocation outside typical ranges (e.g., very low personnel costs for software R&D)

**Fix:**
- Review budget breakdown in Section 8.1 (Budget Summary by Year and Cost Code)
- Document justification if non-typical allocation is correct
- Typical software R&D: 65-75% Personnel, 15-25% Equipment, 5-15% Other Operating Costs, 5-10% Overhead
