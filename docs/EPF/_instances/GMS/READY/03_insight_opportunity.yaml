  title: "Close the Implementation Gap in Marketing Execution for Growth-Oriented SMEs"
  description: |
    Growth-oriented SMEs (€5-50M revenue) face an acute implementation gap: they can generate
    marketing ideas and drafts (AI has made this trivial), but they struggle to turn drafts
    into shipped outcomes reliably. The hard parts aren't "writing"—they're scoping, prioritizing,
    stakeholder alignment, QA, publishing workflow, and sustained cadence.
    
    This gap is widening, not closing, as AI commoditizes drafting. Traditional solutions
    (agencies, freelancers, tools) fail because they either:
    (1) Lack execution structure (freelancers = coordination burden on buyer)
    (2) Optimize for billable hours not outcomes (agencies = scope ambiguity, cost overruns)
    (3) Require internal capacity to operate (tools = implementation gap persists)
    
    The opportunity: Build and operate structured marketing execution systems that deliver
    engineering-grade reliability. Subscription + premium layers provide predictable scope
    and pricing. Atomization + HITL enables scale with accountability. Operating memory
    compounds value over time.
  
  # Market/User Context
  context:
    target_segment: |
      Primary: Growth-oriented B2B SMEs (€5-50M revenue), especially:
      - SaaS and technology companies (digital-native, metrics-driven)
      - Professional services (legal, consulting, accounting) seeking brand positioning
      - Scale-ups (Series A-C) needing marketing capacity without full-time hires
      
      Geographic focus: Nordic and European markets (cultural fit, English + local languages)
      
    pain_points:
      - "Can draft content (AI enables) but can't ship reliably: scoping, QA, publishing workflow gaps"
      - "Scope ambiguity with agencies leads to endless revisions and 30-50% budget waste"
      - "Coordination overhead: 10-20 hours/week managing freelancers, vendors, internal stakeholders"
      - "Execution memory loss: context evaporates when vendors change or team members leave"
      - "No systematization: every project restarts from zero, no learning accumulation"
      
    market_size: |
      TAM: €50B+ global marketing services market
      SAM: €5-8B growth-oriented SME marketing execution (Europe + Nordics)
      SOM: €50-100M managed execution segment (structured delivery, 3-5 year target)
      
    urgency: |
      Why now:
      1. AI has commoditized drafting, making execution gap visible and acute
      2. Remote work normalization enables distributed service delivery
      3. Buyers increasingly demand outcome-based pricing and execution certainty
      4. Incumbents slow to adapt (business model constraints)
      5. Window of opportunity before market consolidates or AI closes the gap autonomously
  
  # Evidence Base
  evidence:
    quantitative:
      - source: "User interviews (N=15 target buyers)"
        insight: "14/15 cited coordination and execution as top pain, not idea generation or drafting"
      
      - source: "Win/loss analysis (N=10 conversions)"
        insight: "100% chose GMS after frustration with scope ambiguity and unreliable delivery from agencies/freelancers"
      
      - source: "Market sizing (Gartner, Forrester, agency reports)"
        insight: "€5-8B addressable market in European SME marketing execution, growing 15-20% annually"
      
    qualitative:
      - source: "Client testimonials and interviews"
        insight: |
          Recurring themes:
          - "We can generate content ideas with ChatGPT. What we can't do is turn them into published work without it consuming all our time."
          - "We're tired of restarting from zero every time we switch vendors or onboard new people."
          - "We need systems, not more ideas or drafts."
      
    competitive_landscape:
      - "Traditional agencies: high cost, scope ambiguity, resistant to automation"
      - "Freelancer marketplaces: low cost but heavy coordination burden, no systematization"
      - "Marketing automation SaaS: tools require internal capacity—doesn't solve execution gap"
      - "White space: Subscription-based managed execution with clear SKU boundaries and engineering-grade reliability"
  
  # Value Hypothesis
  value_hypothesis:
    user_value: |
      Core value delivered:
      1. Execution certainty: Predictable outcomes, clear scope, sustained cadence
      2. Capacity augmentation: Scale marketing without hiring full-time staff
      3. Compounding systems: Operating memory improves with each engagement
      4. Accountability + automation: HITL provides trust, AI enables scale
      
      Tangible benefits:
      - Save 10-20 hours/week on coordination and vendor management
      - Reduce budget waste by 30-50% (scope clarity eliminates overruns)
      - Preserve context across transitions (no restart penalty)
      - Continuously improving quality (SOPs evolve based on feedback)
      
    business_value: |
      For GMS/Coupler:
      1. Subscription revenue: €3-8K/month baseline, premium add-ons for custom work
      2. Compounding margin: Operating memory reduces per-client cost over time
      3. Multi-tenant scale: Shared infrastructure serves multiple clients
      4. Defensible moat: Structured execution systems hard to replicate
      5. Market positioning: "Marketing execution as reliable as engineering delivery"
      
      Unit economics targets:
      - LTV:CAC ratio > 3:1
      - Gross margin > 60% (automation + systematization)
      - Payback period < 12 months
      - Annual retention > 80% (switching cost from operating memory)
