  # ============================================================================
  # 1. PURPOSE - Why We Exist
  # ============================================================================
  # The fundamental reason for being - the problem we exist to solve in the world
  
  purpose:
    statement: |
      We exist to close the implementation gap in marketing execution.
      
      We believe growth-oriented companies deserve marketing execution that is predictable,
      structured, and continuously improving—not a pile of messages, files, and interpretation
      that evaporates when people leave.
    
    problem_we_solve: |
      Marketing services have become fragmented. Buyers face an overwhelming choice set:
      in-house attempts, freelancers, agencies, specialists, tools, templates, and "DIY with AI."
      
      Generative AI has made drafting cheap and fast. What remains expensive is execution certainty:
      scoping, prioritisation, stakeholder alignment, scope management, QA, publishing, and sustained cadence.
      
      The implementation gap: many SMEs can generate plausible drafts, but they struggle to turn them
      into shipped outcomes because the hard parts aren't "writing"—they are turning intent into specs,
      coordinating work, managing scope interpretation, and sustaining momentum over time.
    
    who_we_serve: "Growth-oriented SMEs (mid-market and up) that need marketing to drive growth but lack the internal capacity to build and operate a structured execution system"
    
    impact_we_seek: |
      Marketing execution that is structured, reusable, and continuously improving.
      
      If we succeed: companies can confidently invest in marketing knowing that work will ship,
      learnings will compound, and execution quality will improve over time—not degrade into
      scope fights and forgotten context.
  
  # ============================================================================
  # 2. VISION - Where We Imagine Being in the Future
  # ============================================================================
  # The picture of success - what the world looks like when we've fulfilled our purpose
  
  vision:
    vision_statement: |
      A world where marketing execution is as reliable and measurable as engineering delivery.
      
      Where work is structured, reusable, and continuously improving. Where agencies compete
      on execution throughput with control, not on how many drafts they can generate.
      
      Where the value of a marketing provider is measured by certainty of shipped outcomes,
      not hours spent producing.
    
    timeframe: "5-10 years"
    
    success_looks_like:
      - "Marketing work is machine-readable by default—structured into specs, SOPs, dependencies, and states"
      - "Execution memory compounds: learnings from each delivery improve future work, SOPs evolve based on labeled corrections"
      - "The market splits into clear tiers: commodity production at scale, managed execution systems, judgment-led partners, and tool/platform plays"
      - "Coupler operates a multi-tenant system serving multiple clients and partner agencies with shared infrastructure"
      - "Subscription + premium manual layers is the standard pricing model for structured execution"
    
    not_the_vision:
      - "We are NOT trying to become a pure SaaS platform company (that's conditional optionality)"
      - "We are NOT competing on commodity volume or lowest price per draft"
      - "We are NOT building fully autonomous AI services—HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) is core to our model"
  
  # ============================================================================
  # 3. MISSION - What We Do to Deliver Value
  # ============================================================================
  # The concrete activities and offerings that fulfill our purpose and move us toward vision
  
  mission:
    mission_statement: |
      We build and operate structured marketing execution systems for growth-oriented SMEs.
      
      We digitise the work of turning marketing intent into shipped outcomes by making execution
      machine-readable: specs, SOPs, dependencies, states, and learning signals.
    
    what_we_do:
      - "Structured delivery: Turn repeatable marketing work into explicit specs, SOPs, and structured database records"
      - "Execution orchestration: Coordinate drafting (AI), refinement (human), and implementation across channels and vendors"
      - "Subscription + premium layers: Package baseline production (subscription) with bounded manual work (premium add-ons)"
      - "Multi-tenant operations: Serve multiple clients and partner agencies through shared, structured infrastructure"
    
    how_we_deliver:
      approach: |
        Our distinctive approach is atomisation + Human-in-the-Loop (HITL).
        
        Work is decomposed into structured "bricks" (specs, SOPs, acceptance criteria, dependencies, states)
        so it becomes machine-readable. AI produces high-leverage drafts and structure. Humans make
        the final interpretive call where ambiguity and accountability require it.
        
        This enables us to charge premium for human responsibility and judgment (where pure AI services
        cannot credibly take accountability) while automation handles the bulk of drafting and coordination.
      
      key_capabilities:
        - "Standardisation: Turn agency work into reusable SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) with defined scope, SOPs, and quality criteria"
        - "Operating memory: Preserve negotiation context, decisions, and learnings in structured records that compound over time"
        - "AI agent orchestration: Configure AI agents to produce drafts using our SOPs and data as guidance, with HITL for final decisions"
        - "Scope management: Convert continuous interpretation (negotiation reality) into structured state changes without forcing premature classification"
    
    who_we_serve_specifically: |
      Growth-oriented SMEs (mid-market and up), especially:
      - Technology-driven and innovation-oriented companies
      - Nordic and European clients in SaaS, IT, renewables, ESG, professional services
      - Companies with ambitions to scale internationally
      - Buyers who need marketing to drive growth but lack internal capacity to operationalise it
    
    boundaries:
      we_dont_do:
        - "Compete on commodity volume or price-per-draft races"
        - "Build fully autonomous AI services (HITL is core to our model)"
        - "Lead with IT-style SLAs (we start under agency T&Cs and prove operational performance first)"
        - "Jump to SaaS/platformisation before proving repeatability and distribution"
      
      why_not: "We focus on execution certainty and compounding advantage through structured data, not on speed-to-market in commodity production or premature platform plays"
  
  # ============================================================================
  # 4. VALUES - How We Behave and Conduct Ourselves
  # ============================================================================
  # Normative rules that guide decisions, behaviors, and culture
  
  values:
    - value: "Execution Certainty Over Creative Novelty"
      definition: |
        We prioritize predictable, repeatable delivery over novel creative approaches.
        Structured execution that ships beats brilliant ideas that stall. We value knowing
        what will happen, when, and at what quality level—not surprise and improvisation.
      
      behaviors_we_expect:
        - "Decompose work into explicit specs, SOPs, and acceptance criteria before starting"
        - "Document decisions and context so they survive team changes"
        - "Default to repeatable processes over one-off custom approaches"
        - "Make scope changes explicit through structured state management"
      
      behaviors_we_reject:
        - "Starting work without clear scope definition ('let's figure it out as we go')"
        - "Verbal agreements without written documentation"
        - "Custom solutions when reusable patterns exist"
        - "Scope creep disguised as 'flexibility' or 'collaboration'"
      
      example_decision: |
        When a client requested a "creative approach" to content without defined scope,
        we chose to invest 2 extra days defining specs and SOPs upfront rather than
        start drafting. Result: clearer expectations, fewer revision loops, and reusable
        process for future clients. Execution certainty won over speed-to-draft.
    
    - value: "Structure Compounds, Chaos Decays"
      definition: |
        We believe structured, machine-readable work creates compounding advantage.
        Each delivery improves future work through better SOPs, labeled feedback, and
        accumulated context. Unstructured work (email chains, verbal agreements,
        undocumented decisions) creates mounting coordination debt.
      
      behaviors_we_expect:
        - "Capture learnings in structured records that inform future work"
        - "Update SOPs based on labeled corrections and feedback"
        - "Preserve negotiation context in database, not email threads"
        - "Build reusable components (SKUs) rather than starting from scratch each time"
      
      behaviors_we_reject:
        - "Treating each project as net-new without leveraging past work"
        - "Leaving decisions undocumented ('we discussed this in Slack')"
        - "Repeating the same mistakes because learnings weren't captured"
        - "Optimizing for short-term speed at the cost of long-term reusability"
      
      example_decision: |
        When faced with a tight deadline for a lead generation campaign, we could have
        skipped updating our Lead Gen Engine SOP to save 3 hours. Instead, we documented
        the new approach so the next team could start from a better baseline. Short-term
        slowdown, long-term acceleration. Structure compounds.
    
    - value: "Human Judgment Where It Matters, Automation Everywhere Else"
      definition: |
        We use AI for high-leverage drafting and structure, but reserve final interpretive
        calls for humans. This isn't about "keeping humans in the loop" for its own sake—
        it's about placing accountability where it belongs. Humans own ambiguity and context.
        AI owns repetitive transformation and initial structure.
      
      behaviors_we_expect:
        - "Use AI to draft SOPs, specs, and content at scale"
        - "Require human review for final approval, especially where interpretation or accountability is needed"
        - "Design processes that separate drafting (AI-friendly) from judgment (human-owned)"
        - "Continuously expand what we can confidently automate"
      
      behaviors_we_reject:
        - "Fully autonomous AI with no human accountability"
        - "Manual work on tasks that should be automated"
        - "Treating AI as 'the oracle' without critical human oversight"
        - "Defensive anti-automation ('we need humans for this') without evidence"
      
      example_decision: |
        For website renewal content, AI generates initial page drafts using client's brand
        guidelines and positioning. Human strategist reviews for tone, nuance, and strategic
        alignment before approval. AI handles 80% of drafting work, human handles 20% of
        critical judgment. This separation lets us scale while maintaining accountability.
    
    - value: "Charge for Certainty, Not Hours"
      definition: |
        Our pricing model reflects execution certainty: subscription for baseline production,
        premium for bounded manual work. We don't sell hours or effort—we sell shipped outcomes
        with predictable scope and quality. This forces us to be honest about what's repeatable
        (subscription) versus what requires interpretation (premium).
      
      behaviors_we_expect:
        - "Package work as SKUs with defined scope, quality criteria, and pricing"
        - "Separate subscription work (repeatable) from premium work (manual/custom)"
        - "Be transparent about what's included versus what requires premium add-ons"
        - "Continuously move work from premium to subscription as we systematize it"
      
      behaviors_we_reject:
        - "Hourly billing that rewards inefficiency"
        - "Vague scope definitions that enable endless revisions"
        - "Bundling manual work into subscription to appear 'full-service'"
        - "Resisting systematization to protect billable hours"
      
      example_decision: |
        When designing the Content Cadence offering, we separated repeatable production
        (4 blog posts/month at standard quality) from strategy work (topic ideation,
        SEO keyword research). Standard production: subscription. Strategic input: premium.
        This created clarity for clients and forced us to systematize what we could.
  
  value_conflicts:
    - tension: "Execution Certainty vs. Speed-to-Market"
      resolution_principle: |
        We choose execution certainty. Shipping structured work that's reusable beats
        rushing unstructured work that creates future debt. However, we timebox upfront
        specification (max 20% of project time) to avoid analysis paralysis.
    
    - tension: "Automation vs. Human Judgment"
      resolution_principle: |
        We automate everything that can be confidently systematized. When uncertain,
        we start with HITL (human-in-the-loop) and gradually expand automation as
        confidence grows. Judgment stays human; execution scales through automation.
  
  # ============================================================================
  # 5. CORE BELIEFS - First Principles That Underpin Our Reasoning
  # ============================================================================
  # The fundamental assumptions and beliefs that guide our deductive reasoning
  # These are the "axioms" from which we derive strategy and decisions
  
  core_beliefs:
    about_our_market:
      - belief: "AI has commoditized drafting but not execution certainty"
        implication: |
          Therefore, we compete on structured delivery and execution orchestration,
          not on speed-to-draft or cost-per-word. The market will split into tiers:
          commodity production (AI-only), managed execution systems (our play),
          and judgment-led strategy partners (premium tier).
        evidence: |
          Generative AI can produce plausible drafts in seconds. But SMEs still struggle
          to turn drafts into shipped work due to scoping, stakeholder alignment,
          QA, and sustained momentum. The "implementation gap" is growing, not shrinking.
      
      - belief: "Marketing services market is fragmenting, not consolidating"
        implication: |
          Therefore, buyers face choice overload (in-house, freelancers, agencies, specialists,
          tools, templates, DIY+AI). We must offer clear packaging (SKUs) and transparent
          scope boundaries to reduce decision complexity.
        evidence: |
          Traditional agencies face pressure from AI tools, freelancer marketplaces, and
          specialized boutiques. No dominant player is emerging—instead, more micro-segmentation.
          Buyers report decision fatigue: "too many options, unclear trade-offs."
      
      - belief: "Execution memory is the new moat, not creative IP"
        implication: |
          Therefore, we invest in structured data (SOPs, specs, labeled feedback) that compounds
          over time. Agencies that optimize for short-term billable hours will lose to those
          that build reusable execution systems.
        evidence: |
          Traditional agencies lose institutional memory when people leave. Clients restart
          from zero with each new team. Structured execution systems (like engineering CI/CD)
          preserve context and improve over time. Marketing has no equivalent—yet.
    
    about_our_users:
      - belief: "SMEs can draft but can't execute at scale"
        implication: |
          Therefore, we don't sell drafting services—we sell execution systems.
          Our clients already have ChatGPT. What they lack is the operating structure
          to turn drafts into shipped outcomes reliably.
        evidence: |
          Target buyers (growth-oriented SMEs) report: "We can generate content ideas
          and initial drafts. What kills us is scoping, prioritization, QA, publishing
          workflow, and sustained cadence. We need a system, not more drafts."
      
      - belief: "Buyers value certainty over creativity in execution"
        implication: |
          Therefore, we lead with process transparency and scope clarity, not with
          creative portfolios or 'award-winning campaigns.' Our sales pitch is
          'you'll know what you're getting, when, and at what quality level.'
        evidence: |
          Win/loss analysis shows buyers choose us when they're frustrated by:
          (1) scope ambiguity, (2) missed deadlines, (3) inconsistent quality.
          They don't mention 'creative excellence' as a decision driver.
      
      - belief: "Internal capacity is the constraint, not budget"
        implication: |
          Therefore, we position as 'marketing operations partner' (extending capacity)
          not 'creative agency' (selling campaigns). Pricing should reflect capacity
          augmentation, not project fees.
        evidence: |
          Target segment has marketing budgets but lacks bandwidth to operationalize.
          They'd rather pay for structured delivery than hire full-time coordinators.
    
    about_our_approach:
      - belief: "Atomization enables scale: work must be decomposable into structured 'bricks'"
        implication: |
          Therefore, we invest heavily in turning agency work into explicit specs, SOPs,
          dependencies, and states. If work can't be atomized (fully custom, high-touch
          strategy), it stays premium-tier, not subscription.
        evidence: |
          Engineering achieved scale through CI/CD, microservices, and infrastructure-as-code—
          all forms of atomization. Marketing execution has no equivalent. Early pilots
          show 3x throughput when work is structured vs. ad-hoc.
      
      - belief: "Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) is a feature, not a limitation"
        implication: |
          Therefore, we charge premium for human judgment and accountability. Pure AI services
          can't credibly take responsibility where ambiguity or high stakes exist. HITL lets
          us justify pricing that autonomous tools can't.
        evidence: |
          Clients are willing to pay 2-3x for 'AI + human review' vs 'AI-only' because they
          need accountability. Fully automated marketing services (e.g., Jasper AI) are cheap
          but lack strategic oversight. We occupy the middle ground.
      
      - belief: "Subscription + premium layers is the sustainable model"
        implication: |
          Therefore, we package baseline production (subscription: predictable scope, repeatable work)
          separate from manual/strategic layers (premium: interpretation, custom work). This forces
          discipline: systematize what we can, charge premium for what we can't.
        evidence: |
          SaaS + services hybrid models (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce) show this works:
          software handles repeatable workflows, services handle custom implementation.
          We apply the same logic to marketing execution.
    
    about_value_creation:
      - belief: "Value compounds through operating memory, not through hours spent"
        implication: |
          Therefore, our business model rewards repeatability and learning, not effort.
          Each delivery should improve the system (better SOPs, refined processes), creating
          increasing margin over time as execution gets more efficient.
        evidence: |
          Traditional agency model: flat or declining margin as client demands grow.
          Structured system model: increasing margin as systematization improves.
          Software businesses prove this: unit costs decline as scale increases.
      
      - belief: "Clients pay for shipped outcomes, not inputs or effort"
        implication: |
          Therefore, we price on outcomes (e.g., '4 published blog posts with SEO optimization')
          not inputs ('40 hours of content work'). This aligns our incentives with clients:
          we win by getting more efficient, not by billing more hours.
        evidence: |
          Outcome-based pricing reduces buyer anxiety ('am I getting good value?') and
          forces us to systematize. Hourly billing creates perverse incentives to be slow.
    
    about_competition:
      - belief: "Market will split into clear tiers: commodity, managed execution, judgment-led strategy"
        implication: |
          Therefore, we don't try to compete on price (commodity tier) or brand prestige
          (judgment-led tier). We compete on execution certainty and throughput:
          'marketing execution as reliable as engineering delivery.'
        evidence: |
          Similar patterns in other markets: managed cloud services (AWS) between self-hosted (cheap)
          and consulting firms (expensive). Market rewards the structured middle tier.
      
      - belief: "Traditional agencies will struggle to adapt because billable hours incentivize inefficiency"
        implication: |
          Therefore, our competitive advantage is structural, not just operational. Agencies
          optimized for time-and-materials can't easily shift to outcome-based pricing without
          rebuilding their entire operating model.
        evidence: |
          Incumbent agencies resist automation ('it'll replace our people') and systematization
          ('every client is unique'). This creates opening for structured execution players.
    
    belief_challenges:
      - belief: "AI has commoditized drafting but not execution certainty"
        counter_evidence: |
          If AI agents become capable of full end-to-end execution (scoping, QA, publishing,
          stakeholder coordination), the execution gap might close without human-in-the-loop.
          This would commoditize our core value proposition.
        monitoring: |
          Track AI agent capabilities quarterly. Monitor: (1) Can agents handle multi-step
          workflows with context preservation? (2) Can clients trust AI for final approval?
          (3) Are new 'full-stack marketing AI' products emerging?
      
      - belief: "Buyers value certainty over creativity in execution"
        counter_evidence: |
          High-growth startups or brand-focused companies might prioritize creative differentiation
          over execution reliability. If our target segment shifts upmarket, this belief may
          not hold.
        monitoring: |
          Track win/loss analysis. If we start losing deals to creative agencies (not efficiency
          concerns), this belief needs revision. Survey clients on decision criteria annually.
  
  # ============================================================================
  # CONSISTENCY & ALIGNMENT
  # ============================================================================
  
  alignment_checks:
    purpose_vision_alignment: |
      Our purpose is to close the implementation gap in marketing execution. Our vision is
      a world where marketing execution is as reliable as engineering delivery. These are
      mutually reinforcing: the purpose identifies the problem (implementation gap), the
      vision articulates the solution state (engineering-grade reliability). If we achieve
      our vision, we fulfill our purpose.
    
    mission_purpose_alignment: |
      Our mission—building and operating structured marketing execution systems—directly
      serves our purpose of closing the implementation gap. By making execution machine-readable
      (specs, SOPs, states), we turn the chaotic 'gap' into a structured system. The mission
      is the operational expression of the purpose.
    
    values_mission_alignment: |
      Our values (Execution Certainty, Structure Compounds, HITL, Charge for Certainty)
      directly enable our mission. We can't build structured execution systems without
      valuing structure over chaos. We can't operate sustainably without charging for
      certainty rather than hours. Values and mission are tightly aligned.
    
    beliefs_inform_strategy: |
      Our core beliefs shape every strategic choice:
      - Belief that AI commoditized drafting → Strategy: compete on execution, not creative output
      - Belief that execution memory is the moat → Strategy: invest in SOPs and structured data
      - Belief that SMEs can draft but can't execute → Strategy: sell systems, not services
      - Belief in subscription + premium layers → Strategy: systematize baseline, charge for custom
      
      Every strategic decision should trace back to one or more core beliefs. If a proposed
      strategy doesn't align with beliefs, either the strategy is wrong or a belief needs updating.
