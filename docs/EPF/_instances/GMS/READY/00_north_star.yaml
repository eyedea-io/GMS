# NORTH STAR: Organizational Strategic Foundation
# This document contains the enduring strategic context for the entire product organization.
# These elements are relatively stable and inform all EPF cycles, but should be reviewed annually
# or when fundamental strategic shifts occur.
#
# STABILITY: This document changes rarely (annually or during major pivots)
# SCOPE: Organization-wide, not cycle-specific
# INFORMS: All READY phase artifacts (analyses, opportunity, strategy, roadmap)

  # ============================================================================
  # 1. PURPOSE - Why We Exist
  # ============================================================================
  # The fundamental reason for being - the problem we exist to solve in the world
  
  purpose:
    statement: |
      A clear, inspiring statement of why your organization exists.
      Not what you do, but WHY you do it.
      Should be timeless and aspirational.
      
      Example: "We exist to democratize access to world-class education"
      Example: "We exist to eliminate preventable suffering in healthcare"
      Example: "We exist to help teams do their best work without burnout"
    
    problem_we_solve: |
      The fundamental human or organizational problem we're addressing.
      This should be enduring - likely still relevant in 10+ years.
    
    who_we_serve: "The broadest definition of who benefits from our existence"
    
    impact_we_seek: |
      The ultimate change we want to create in the world.
      If we succeed wildly, what's different?
  
  # ============================================================================
  # 2. VISION - Where We Imagine Being in the Future
  # ============================================================================
  # The picture of success - what the world looks like when we've fulfilled our purpose
  
  vision:
    vision_statement: |
      A vivid, inspiring picture of the future (5-10 years).
      Should be ambitious but believable.
      Should paint a picture anyone can understand.
      
      Example: "A world where every child has access to personalized learning"
      Example: "Every team works with clarity, alignment, and joy"
      Example: "Healthcare decisions are always informed by the best evidence"
    
    timeframe: "5-10 years"
    
    success_looks_like:
      - "Observable indicator 1: What we see in the world"
      - "Observable indicator 2: How people's lives are different"
      - "Observable indicator 3: What our market/industry looks like"
      - "Observable indicator 4: What our organization looks like"
    
    not_the_vision:
      - "Clarification 1: What we're NOT trying to become"
      - "Clarification 2: Boundaries on our ambition"
  
  # ============================================================================
  # 3. MISSION - What We Do to Deliver Value
  # ============================================================================
  # The concrete activities and offerings that fulfill our purpose and move us toward vision
  
  mission:
    mission_statement: |
      A clear statement of WHAT we do and FOR WHOM.
      More concrete than purpose, more stable than individual products.
      
      Example: "We build AI-powered learning platforms that adapt to each student's needs"
      Example: "We create workflow tools that eliminate coordination overhead for distributed teams"
      Example: "We provide clinical decision support that synthesizes the latest evidence"
    
    what_we_do:
      - "Core activity 1: Primary thing we do"
      - "Core activity 2: Another core activity"
      - "Core activity 3: Supporting activity"
    
    how_we_deliver:
      approach: |
        Our distinctive approach or methodology.
        What makes our way of delivering the mission unique?
      
      key_capabilities:
        - "Capability 1: Core competency we build"
        - "Capability 2: Another essential capability"
    
    who_we_serve_specifically: |
      More specific than purpose - which segments, roles, or personas?
      Can evolve as we expand, but should be clear now.
    
    boundaries:
      we_dont_do:
        - "Activity 1 we explicitly don't do"
        - "Activity 2 that's out of scope"
      
      why_not: "Rationale for these boundaries (focus, competency, strategy)"

# USAGE NOTES
# ============================================================================

usage_guidance: |
  1. REVIEW this document at the start of each major strategic planning cycle
  2. REFERENCE it when making strategic trade-offs or decisions
  3. UPDATE it only when fundamental organizational direction changes
  4. VALIDATE that all READY phase artifacts align with this North Star
  5. USE values and beliefs to resolve strategic tensions
  6. COMMUNICATE this broadly - it should be known across the organization
