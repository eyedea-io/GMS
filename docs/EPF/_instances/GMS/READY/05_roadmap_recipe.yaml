  # EXECUTION PLAN
  # ============================================================================
  
  execution_plan:
    sequencing_rationale: |
      H1 2026 prioritizes Layer 1 (Standardisation) and Layer 2 (Offers) validation. Critical path focuses
      on proving subscription model viability—this is the riskiest assumption. Sequence:
      
      1. January-February: Build GMS database + define offer set (parallel infrastructure + strategy work)
      2. March: Launch pilot subscriptions—start populating structured records with real client data
      3. April-May: Refine SOPs based on pilot learnings, track efficiency metrics
      4. June: MVP milestone—50% structured record coverage, pricing/margin validation, retention assessment
      
      Rationale: Can't validate pricing until offers are defined; can't measure efficiency until data flows;
      can't refine SOPs until pilots reveal friction. This sequence de-risks subscription model assumption
      (asm-c-001) before scaling investment in H2 2026.
