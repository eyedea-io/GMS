  # POSITIONING
  # ============================================================================
  
  positioning:
    unique_value_proposition: "Marketing execution as reliable as engineering delivery—structured systems with subscription pricing and compounding operating memory"
    
    target_customer_profile: |
      Primary: Marketing Directors and CMOs at growth-oriented B2B SMEs (€5-50M revenue)
      - Especially SaaS and technology companies (digital-native, metrics-driven)
      - Also professional services (legal, consulting, accounting) seeking brand positioning
      - Scale-ups (Series A-C) needing marketing capacity without full-time hires
      
      Geographic focus: Nordic and European markets (cultural fit, English + local languages)
      
      Characteristics:
      - Generate ideas and drafts easily (AI helps) but struggle to ship reliably
      - Frustrated with agency scope ambiguity and freelancer coordination burden
      - Value predictability and systematization over creative novelty
      - Willing to pay premium for execution certainty (€3-8K/month subscription)
    
    category_position: |
      We compete in the emerging "managed execution tier" between commodity production and
      judgment-led strategy consulting. Not a traditional agency (we don't compete on creative
      awards), not a freelancer marketplace (we provide structure not just talent), not a SaaS
      tool (we operate the system, not just provide software).
      
      We position as "structured execution partner"—the reliable middle tier that delivers
      engineering-grade systematization for marketing workflows.
    
    positioning_statement: |
      For growth-oriented SMEs who need marketing execution without the coordination chaos of
      freelancers or the scope ambiguity of traditional agencies, GMS is a managed execution
      partner that provides subscription-based structured delivery systems. Unlike agencies
      that optimize for billable hours or freelancers that require heavy buyer coordination,
      we compete on execution throughput with control—clear SKU boundaries, predictable outcomes,
      and compounding operating memory that improves with each engagement.
    
    tagline_candidates:
      - "Marketing execution as reliable as engineering delivery"
      - "Execution certainty for growth-oriented SMEs"
      - "Structured marketing systems that compound"
      - "Subscription-based execution with control"

  competitive_moat:
    advantages:
      - name: "Proprietary operating memory"
        description: "Accumulated SOPs, negotiation context, and labeled corrections from each client engagement"
        defensibility: "Compounding data advantage—competitors starting from zero can't replicate 2+ years of structured learnings"
        evidence: "Each engagement improves baseline processes; second clients 20% more efficient than first"
      
      - name: "GMS 6-table architecture"
        description: "Structured execution primitives (Offers, Deliverables, Commitments, StateChanges, Corrections, Blocks) enable machine-readable tracking"
        defensibility: "2+ years of development invested in atomization model; architectural advantage hard to replicate without deep systematization expertise"
        evidence: "Core competency validated through pilot clients; enables both HITL accountability and automation scale"
      
      - name: "HITL positioning"
        description: "Human-in-the-loop model provides accountability layer that pure AI tools lack"
        defensibility: "Structural advantage—buyers trust human judgment for final decisions; pure AI can't credibly take responsibility"
        evidence: "Win/loss analysis: buyers choose us for human accountability + AI efficiency, not AI-only or human-only"
    
    differentiation: |
      We compete on execution throughput with control. Three-part formula:
      1. Systematization (atomization + SOPs) provides repeatability and scale
      2. Operating memory compounds value—we get better over time, not just bigger
      3. HITL model balances automation (AI drafts) with accountability (human approval)
      
      This combination is defensible: agencies resist automation (threatens billable hours),
      freelancer marketplaces lack systematization, SaaS tools require internal capacity to
      operate. We occupy the structured middle tier.

  # BUSINESS MODEL
  # ============================================================================
  
  business_model:
    revenue_model: |
      Subscription + premium layers:
      
      1. Subscription (€3-8K/month): Baseline production with clear SKU boundaries
         - Repeatable work: standard blog posts, social content, email campaigns
         - Defined quality criteria and acceptance tests
         - Recurring revenue, predictable capacity
      
      2. Premium (project-based): Manual/strategic layers requiring interpretation
         - Custom work: positioning narratives, strategic content, brand guidelines
         - Bounded human work with explicit scope
         - Higher margin, one-time or periodic
      
      3. Multi-tenant infrastructure: Shared systems across clients
         - Fixed costs amortized: database, SOPs, AI orchestration
         - Operating memory compounds for all clients
         - Scale without linear cost growth
    
    pricing_strategy: |
      Outcome-based pricing, not hourly:
      - Subscription priced on delivered outcomes (e.g., "4 blog posts/month with SEO optimization")
      - Premium priced on bounded scope (e.g., "Positioning narrative: 3 rounds of revision")
      - Never bill hours—aligns incentives (we win by getting efficient, not slow)
      
      Initial offer set (Layer 2, H2 2026):
      1. Website Renewal System: €5-12K project (premium) + €2K/month maintenance (subscription)

  # ============================================================================
  # STRATEGIC CONSTRAINTS & TRADE-OFFS
  # ============================================================================
  
  constraints:
    - constraint: "Small team capacity"
      implication: "Can't scale through team growth alone—must systematize and leverage partners"
      mitigation: "Layer-based sequencing: standardize (L1) → offers (L2) → automate (L3) → partner (L4)"
    
    - constraint: "HITL accountability requirement"
      implication: "Can't fully automate—human judgment stays in the loop for responsibility"
      mitigation: "Separate drafting (AI) from approval (human); continuously expand automation boundary"
    
    - constraint: "Operating memory requires critical mass"
      implication: "Learning systems don't provide ROI until 50+ deliverables accumulated"
      mitigation: "Start manual (Layer 1-2), build data foundation, automate once patterns clear (Layer 3)"
  
  trade_offs:
    - decision: "Subscription + SKUs vs. custom everything"
      what_we_choose: "SKU-based packaging with clear scope boundaries"
      what_we_reject: "Fully custom work that doesn't systematize"
      rationale: "Systematization enables scale and compounding; custom work doesn't create operating memory"
      tension: "Some buyers want full flexibility—we accommodate via premium layers but resist scope creep"
    
    - decision: "HITL vs. full automation"
      what_we_choose: "Human-in-the-loop: AI drafts, human approves"
      what_we_reject: "Fully autonomous AI with no human accountability"
      rationale: "Buyers trust human judgment; HITL is differentiator not limitation"
      tension: "HITL limits scale vs pure automation—we mitigate by expanding automation boundary over time"
    
    - decision: "Managed execution vs. SaaS platform"
      what_we_choose: "We operate the system for clients (managed service)"
      what_we_reject: "Self-service software that requires internal capacity to operate"
      rationale: "Buyers need execution capacity, not more tools; solving implementation gap requires operating the system"
      tension: "Managed service margins < SaaS—we compensate through multi-tenant leverage and premium pricing"
  
  # ============================================================================
  # STRATEGIC RISKS
  # ============================================================================
  
  risks:
    - risk: "AI agents achieve full autonomy → HITL defensibility erodes"
      probability: "medium" # 3-5 year horizon
      impact: "high" # Would undermine core positioning
      mitigation: |
        Monitor AI capabilities closely; expand automation boundary incrementally but keep human approval
        on strategic/accountability layers. If full autonomy emerges, pivot to Layer 5 (analytics/intelligence)
        or judgment-led strategy tier (higher margin).
      indicator: "Watch for: AI agents handling multi-step workflows autonomously with >95% accuracy"
    
    - risk: "Subscription pricing doesn't resonate—buyers default to hourly/project model"
      probability: "low" # Early validation positive
      impact: "high" # Would force business model pivot
      mitigation: |
        Layer 1 MVP (H1 2026) tests this assumption with 3 pilot clients. If pricing rejected, offer
        hybrid model (partial subscription) or pivot to project-based with premium SKUs.
      indicator: "Track: subscription retention <60% or buyers resist paying upfront"
    
    - risk: "Operating memory doesn't compound—systematization fails to improve efficiency"
      probability: "low" # Architecture designed for this
      impact: "high" # Would eliminate moat
      mitigation: |
        Layer 3 (2027) specifically validates compounding hypothesis. Start manual, track efficiency
        metrics, only automate when patterns clear. If compounding fails, focus on other moats
        (HITL accountability, SKU packaging).
      indicator: "Track: second client engagements NOT 20% faster than first; SOPs not improving"
    
    - risk: "Market consolidates before we achieve scale—incumbent acquires structured execution startup"
      probability: "low-medium" # Emerging category
      impact: "medium" # Competition intensifies but doesn't eliminate opportunity
      mitigation: |
        Build defensible moat quickly: accumulate operating memory (Layer 3), establish partner
        channel (Layer 4), create case studies proving execution certainty. First-mover advantage
        in structured execution tier.
      indicator: "Watch for: Large agency acquisitions of systematization-focused startups"
