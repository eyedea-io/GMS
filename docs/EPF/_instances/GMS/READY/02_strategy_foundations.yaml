# EPF v1.13.0 - Strategy Foundations Template
# STRATEGY Phase: Foundational Strategic Artifacts
# This is a living document containing four core strategic definitions that inform the winning formula.
# These artifacts must be consistent with:
# - Organizational North Star (00_north_star.yaml)
# - INSIGHT analyses (01_insight_analyses.yaml)
# - Opportunity statement (03_insight_opportunity.yaml)
#
# CHANGE PROTOCOL: If any of these foundations change, you MUST update 04_strategy_formula.yaml to maintain consistency
