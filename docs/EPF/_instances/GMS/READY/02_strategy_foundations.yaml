  # 1. PRODUCT VISION
  # ============================================================================
  
  product_vision:
    vision_statement: |
      Marketing execution as reliable and measurable as engineering delivery. Growth-oriented
      SMEs can confidently invest in marketing knowing that work will ship predictably,
      learnings will compound through structured operating memory, and execution quality
      improves over time—not degrades into scope fights and forgotten context.
    
    target_timeframe: "3-5 years"
    
    success_indicators:
      - indicator: "50% of structured deliverables have machine-readable records"
        target: "By 2026 (MVP), increasing to 80% by 2028"
      - indicator: "Operating memory visibly compounds across engagements"
        target: "SOPs evolve based on labeled corrections, execution efficiency improves 20% year-over-year"
      - indicator: "Multi-tenant GMS serves multiple clients and partner agencies"
        target: "3-5 concurrent clients by 2027, partner channel operational by 2028"
      - indicator: "Subscription + premium layers standard pricing model"
        target: "80% of revenue from recurring subscription base by 2028"

        - trend: "Marketing services market fragmenting into micro-specialists"
          how_it_informs: "Creates demand for clear SKU-based packaging and scope boundaries"
        - trend: "Buyers expect outcome-based pricing, not time-and-materials"

  # 3. STRATEGIC SEQUENCING
  # ============================================================================
  
  strategic_sequencing:
    sequencing_principle: |
      Layer-based value delivery: Start with standardisation (Layer 1) to establish repeatability,
      then add capability/offers (Layer 2) to prove market fit, then learning systems (Layer 3)
      to create moat, then responsibility infrastructure (Layer 4) for multi-tenant scale, and
      finally prediction/analytics (Layer 5, optional) for strategic intelligence. This sequence
      prioritizes proving execution certainty early, then building compounding advantages.
    
    phases:
      - phase: 1
        name: "Standardisation (Layer 1)"
        timeframe: "H1 2026"
        focus: "Establish structured execution foundation—prove we can deliver predictably"
        
        target_segment: "Growth-oriented B2B SaaS (2-3 pilot clients)"
        target_problem: "Implementation gap: can draft but can't ship reliably"
        
        value_delivered:
          - "Clear SKU-based offers with explicit scope and acceptance criteria"
          - "Structured database capturing Offers, Deliverables, Commitments, StateChanges"
          - "Basic SOPs for initial offer set (6 offers)"
        
        success_criteria:
          - "MVP June 2026: 50% of deliverables have structured records"
          - "3 active subscription clients with >80% retention"
          - "Operating memory demonstrably improves second client engagements"
        
        strategic_rationale: |
          De-risk core assumption: buyers will pay subscription prices for structured execution.
          Establish repeatability before scaling. Build proof points for Layer 2 offer packaging.
          Foundation must work before adding capability layers.
      
      - phase: 2
        name: "Capability & Offers (Layer 2)"
        timeframe: "H2 2026"
        focus: "Package and validate initial offer set—prove market fit and pricing"

          - "5-7 active clients across B2B SaaS and professional services"
          - "Pricing validated: >60% gross margin, <12 month payback"
          - "Partner onboarding Q3 2026: 1 partner delivering through GMS"
        
        strategic_rationale: "Prove offers resonate with market before investing in learning infrastructure. Multi-segment validation reduces risk of narrow applicability."
      
      - phase: 3
        name: "Learning (Layer 3)"
        timeframe: "2027"
        focus: "Build operating memory systems that compound—create moat through accumulated knowledge"
        
        enabled_by_phase_1: "Structured records from Layer 1 provide training data for learning systems"

          - "Client testimonials emphasizing operating memory value"
        
        strategic_rationale: "Learning systems create defensible moat—accumulated knowledge compounds and becomes hard to replicate. Timing: need critical mass of data before learning systems provide ROI."
      
      - phase: 4
        name: "Responsibility (Layer 4)"
        timeframe: "2028"

          - "Operating margin >40% through systematization and leverage"
        
        strategic_rationale: "Scale requires leverage—partners provide capacity without team size explosion. Layer 4 builds on Layers 1-3: can't partner without standardisation, offers, and learning."
      
      - phase: 5
        name: "Prediction (Layer 5, Optional/Conditional)"
        timeframe: "2029+"
        focus: "Strategic intelligence from execution data—conditional on SaaS viability"
        
        enabled_by_phase_1: "Accumulated execution data enables predictive analytics and benchmarking"
        
        target_segment: "Enterprise clients seeking strategic insights"

        success_criteria:
          - "Analytics drive 10-20% additional efficiency"
          - "Premium tier clients willing to pay for strategic intelligence"
          - "Conditional: only pursue if SaaS-mode viability proven"
        
        strategic_rationale: "Layer 5 is optional—pursue only if execution data creates defensible insights that justify SaaS product investment. Otherwise stay in managed execution tier."
    
    sequencing_constraints:
      dependencies:
        - "Layer 1 must prove subscription pricing viable before investing in Layer 2 offer development"
        - "Layer 3 requires critical mass of structured data (50+ deliverables) before learning ROI positive"
        - "Layer 4 partner channel requires proven Layer 2 offers and Layer 3 operating memory"
        - "Layer 5 conditional on accumulated data showing predictive value"
      
      risks_of_sequence:
        - "Risk: Layer 1 MVP too slow to market—mitigation: timebox to 6 months, prioritize ruthlessly"
        - "Risk: Layer 2 offers don't resonate—mitigation: validate with pilot clients before full build"
        - "Risk: Layer 3 learning systems don't compound—mitigation: start manual, automate only when patterns clear"
      
      alternative_considered: "Alternative: Start with Layer 5 SaaS product. Rejected because: (1) no moat without operating memory, (2) buyers don't trust pure software for execution, (3) HITL accountability is differentiator not bug."
    
    consistency_check:

  # 4. INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
  # ============================================================================
  
  information_architecture:
    architecture_philosophy: |
      GMS 6-table architecture: Organize around execution primitives (Offers, Deliverables,
      Commitments, StateChanges, Corrections, Blocks) rather than projects or campaigns. This
      enables atomic tracking, machine-readable state management, and compounding operating memory.
      Users think in terms of "what needs to ship" and "what's the state," not abstract projects.
    
    mental_model:
      user_thinks_in_terms_of:
        - "Offers (SKUs): What we're buying/selling with clear scope"
        - "Deliverables: What needs to ship with acceptance criteria"
        - "State: Where are we in the workflow (committed → in progress → review → shipped)"
      
      not_in_terms_of:
        - "Abstract 'projects' without clear deliverables"
        - "Hours or effort (we sell outcomes, not time)"
