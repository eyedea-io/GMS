# GMS Product Value Model
# EPF v1.13.0
#
# This document defines the value delivered by GMS (Growth Marketing System)
# across multiple user types: Clients, Contributors, Agency Staff, and System Administrators.
#
# CRITICAL: This is a BRIDGE DOCUMENT serving two audiences:
# 1. Business Stakeholders (investors, executives, BD) - must understand value without technical knowledge
# 2. Engineering Teams (developers, architects, DevOps) - need implementation context
#
# LANGUAGE RULES:
# - Component names & UVPs: BUSINESS LANGUAGE ONLY (what value, who benefits)
# - Context tags: Technical details prefixed with "Technical:" for engineering team
# - See docs/guides/VALUE_MODEL_BUSINESS_LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md for complete guidance

activation_notes: |
  GMS is being built as an integrated system across all layers. Start with Client App and Agency App
  as primary value delivery layers, then expand Contributor App features as contributor ecosystem grows.
  Admin App is foundational for multi-tenant operations. Technical Infrastructure supports all layers.

  Activation sequence:
  1. Layer 1 (Client App) - Core visibility and collaboration features
  2. Layer 2 (Agency App) - Project management and resource allocation
  3. Layer 3 (Contributor App) - Task management and skill matching
  4. Layer 4 (Admin App) - Organization and security management
  5. Layer 5 (Technical Infrastructure) - Scalable, secure foundation
