strategic_context:
  problem_statement: 'Organizations accumulate vast amounts of unstructured information across documents, emails, and conversations,
    but struggle to discover hidden relationships and patterns. Knowledge workers spend 40-60% of their time searching for
    information and understanding how different pieces of knowledge connect. Traditional search tools find documents but don''t
    reveal the semantic relationships between entities, making it difficult to answer questions like "What projects are affected
    by this regulation?" or "Who are the key stakeholders for this initiative?" This lack of relationship visibility leads
    to duplicated work, missed opportunities for collaboration, and incomplete understanding of complex business problems.

    '
  market_context: 'Knowledge graph technology has matured rapidly with the rise of graph databases (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)
    and property graph standards (Cypher, Gremlin). Leading tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Facebook) use knowledge graphs
    extensively for search, recommendations, and business intelligence. The global knowledge graph market is projected to
    grow from $680M in 2023 to $2.4B by 2028 (41% CAGR), driven by AI/ML workloads that require structured knowledge representation.
    However, most knowledge graph solutions target enterprise data warehouses and require significant data engineering effort.
    The emerging opportunity is providing knowledge graph capabilities directly within knowledge management workflows, making
    relationship discovery accessible to knowledge workers without technical expertise. Key differentiators include automated
    graph construction from unstructured sources, visual relationship exploration, and natural language query interfaces.

definition:
  job_to_be_done: When knowledge workers need to understand relationships between entities, they want to visually explore
    and query a knowledge graph, so they can discover hidden connections and make informed decisions based on complete context.
  solution_approach: The Knowledge Graph Engine automatically constructs a property graph from extracted entities and relationships,
    storing them in a graph database. Users query the graph through a visual exploration interface with drag-to-expand nodes,
    filter by relationship types, and path finding between entities. Natural language queries translate to Cypher/Gremlin
    graph queries using LLM-powered intent recognition. The system maintains provenance links to source documents for every
    relationship, enabling verification and updates as knowledge evolves.

    actor: Dr. Elena Martinez, Research Director
    context: Quarterly risk review meeting where leadership evaluates research portfolio exposure to external dependencies
      (regulatory changes, supplier relationships, technology platform decisions)
    trigger: CFO asks Elena to assess financial exposure if a major research equipment supplier goes out of business
    action: Elena opens Knowledge Graph, searches for the supplier company entity, and expands all connected project nodes.
      She filters relationships by 'depends_on' type and sorts projects by contract value. The graph reveals 8 projects directly
      using this supplier's equipment and 4 more using compatible equipment from the same supplier family (inferred relationship).
      She clicks through to each project to see timeline implications and alternative supplier options mentioned in project
      notes.
    outcome: 'Within 10 minutes, Elena presents a complete risk profile: $12M of active projects directly exposed, 6-month
      lead time for equipment replacement if switching suppliers, and 2 alternative suppliers with compatible equipment (identified
      through graph traversal of ''similar_to'' relationships between equipment types). CFO decides to diversify equipment
      procurement and Elena has action items with specific project owners to contact.'

      3 weeks of development
    action: 'James queries the graph: ''What features already integrate with Microsoft 365?'' The system shows 4 existing
      features with OAuth implementations, each connecting to different Microsoft APIs (Teams, SharePoint, Exchange, Azure
      AD). He expands the ''Authentication Service'' node and sees all 4 features share a common OAuth library. Following
      edges to team nodes shows that the Platform team maintains this shared library and has documentation for adding new
      OAuth providers. James contacts the Platform team lead shown in the graph.'
    outcome: Platform team shares OAuth integration template that reduces implementation from 3 weeks to 3 days. James documents
      this pattern by adding a 'reusable_component' relationship between the OAuth library and common integration scenarios,
      helping future product managers discover this resource. The graph visualization helps his team see other potential code
      reuse opportunities in the backlog, changing their approach to technical planning.
    acceptance_criteria:

      consent records
    action: 'Aisha queries graph: ''What processes collect marketing consent?'' The system shows 5 data collection points
      (website forms, mobile app, customer service calls, email preferences, partner integrations), each connecting to databases
      storing consent records. She follows edges to see retention policies for each database—discovering that 2 databases
      have 7-year retention (compliant) but 3 have indefinite retention (potentially non-compliant based on new guidance).
      The graph shows which business processes depend on each database, helping her understand impact of policy changes.'
    outcome: Aisha generates a compliance gap report directly from the graph, showing the 3 databases needing policy updates
      and the 8 business processes affected. She exports this subgraph and shares with IT and legal teams via Slack. The graph's
      provenance links point to privacy notices that need updating and data processing agreements that need review. She schedules
      follow-up meetings with specific data owners identified in the graph, accelerating remediation from 2 weeks to 3 days.
    acceptance_criteria:
    - Queries about regulatory topics (GDPR, consent, retention) return relevant business processes and data flows
    - Graph includes metadata on data classifications, retention policies, and regulatory requirements as node properties
    - Users can generate compliance reports by selecting subgraph and exporting with entity details
    - Provenance links connect regulatory requirements to policy documents and legal guidance

    actor: Michael Chang, Enterprise Architect
    context: Architecture review meeting for proposed customer portal modernization project
    trigger: Product team presents project plan to rebuild customer portal using modern React framework, replacing legacy
      ASP.NET application
    action: Michael pulls up the graph showing the current customer portal node and expands all connected systems. The visualization
      reveals 23 direct dependencies (authentication service, customer database, order history API, payment gateway, etc.)
      plus 15 indirect dependencies through shared data sources. He filters by 'API integration' relationships and sees that
      8 services use deprecated SOAP APIs that the new React portal can't consume without building adapters. Following the
      'owned_by' relationships, he identifies 5 different teams that maintain these legacy APIs, understanding organizational
      coordination needs.
    outcome: Michael presents the full dependency graph to the project team, highlighting the 8 legacy API integration challenges
      that weren't in the original project scope. He estimates an additional 6 weeks for API modernization or adapter development.
      The graph helps the team prioritize which APIs to modernize first based on usage patterns (shown by edge thickness representing
      call volume). The project plan is revised with realistic dependencies, preventing scope creep and timeline surprises.
      Product team saves the graph visualization in project documentation for ongoing reference.

    name: Track Knowledge Evolution Over Time
    jtbd_category: big_infrequent
    actor: James Torres, Product Manager
    context: Annual product strategy review where leadership evaluates how product architecture and customer needs have evolved
    trigger: VP asks James to show how feature dependencies have changed since the product launched 18 months ago
    action: 'James uses graph''s temporal query feature to load a snapshot from 18 months ago. The graph shows 12 features
      with relatively simple dependencies. He then loads current state (45 features with complex interdependencies) and uses
      graph''s ''difference view'' to highlight changes: new features added (green nodes), deprecated features removed (red
      nodes), and new relationships formed (blue edges). He creates an animation that transitions between time snapshots,
      visually showing how product complexity has grown.'
    outcome: The temporal graph visualization reveals that 8 'core platform' features have become central hubs with 15+ connections
      each, indicating they're critical infrastructure. This visual evidence supports James's proposal to dedicate a platform
      team to maintain these core features. He also identifies 3 features with minimal connections that are candidates for
      deprecation, saving engineering resources. The time-series analysis becomes a quarterly ritual for architecture governance,
      using graph complexity metrics to guide platform evolution decisions.
    acceptance_criteria:
    - Graph supports temporal queries with date range selection and snapshot comparison
    - Difference view highlights added/removed nodes and edges with distinct visual styling
    - Users can create animations transitioning between time snapshots to show evolution
    - Graph maintains historical provenance showing when relationships were created/modified

  dependencies:
    requires:
    - id: fd-001
      reason: Requires entity extraction from Document Ingestion Pipeline (fd-001) as the primary source of entities and relationships
        to populate the knowledge graph. Without extracted entities, the graph would be empty. The pipeline provides entity
        IDs, types, attributes, and confidence scores that become graph nodes and properties.
      name: Feature fd-001
    - id: fd-003
      reason: Integrates with Semantic Search (fd-003) to provide graph-augmented search results. When users search for entities,
        search results include relationship context from the graph (e.g., 'This person works on 3 projects related to your
        query'). Graph queries can be triggered from search result pages to explore relationships visually.
      name: Feature fd-003
    enables:
    - id: fd-004
      reason: Provides structured relationship data that improves LLM Processing Pipeline (fd-004) context understanding.
        When generating responses, the LLM can query the graph to understand entity relationships, improving accuracy of answers
        about complex dependencies and organizational structures. Graph provides factual grounding for LLM reasoning.
      name: Feature fd-004
    - id: fd-007
      reason: Powers Real-time Collaboration (fd-007) by enabling relationship-based notifications and activity feeds. When
        users collaborate on entities connected in the graph, the system can suggest relevant stakeholders to include based

  risks:
    technical:
    - risk: Graph database performance degradation with large graphs (>1M nodes, >10M edges)
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: Implement graph partitioning by organization/project boundaries. Use materialized views for common query
        patterns. Cache frequently accessed subgraphs. Monitor query performance and implement query complexity limits. Consider
        read replicas for query scaling. Test with synthetic large-scale graphs during development to identify performance
        bottlenecks early.
    - risk: Relationship inference accuracy issues leading to misleading connections
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: Always show confidence scores for inferred relationships. Provide provenance links to evidence for review.
        Implement user feedback loops where users can confirm/reject inferred relationships. Use conservative inference thresholds
        initially (>80% confidence). A/B test inference algorithms with expert validation sets. Include 'Suggested Relationships'
        section separate from confirmed relationships in UI.
    - risk: Graph schema evolution complexity as new entity and relationship types are added
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: Design flexible graph schema supporting property bags on nodes/edges rather than rigid schema. Use schema
        versioning with migration support. Implement backward compatibility for queries when schema changes. Document relationship
        type ontology with clear semantics. Provide admin tools for merging/splitting relationship types as understanding
        evolves.
    business:
    - risk: User confusion with complex graph visualizations overwhelming instead of clarifying
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: 'Implement progressive disclosure: start with simple 1-hop neighborhoods, allow users to gradually expand.
        Provide graph layout presets optimized for common use cases (hierarchy view, cluster view, timeline view). Include
        interactive tutorial and contextual help explaining graph concepts. Use smart defaults for filters and layouts. A/B
        test visualization approaches with target user groups before general release.'
    - risk: Privacy concerns around relationship visibility revealing sensitive organizational information
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: Implement granular relationship-level permissions inheriting from source document access controls. Provide
        privacy audit logs showing who queried which relationships. Allow administrators to mark sensitive relationship types
        as restricted. Support 'anonymized graph views' where node identities are obscured while preserving structure for
        analysis. Conduct privacy impact assessment with legal review before launch.
  compliance:
    regulatory_requirements:
    - 'GDPR Article 15: Graph queries must respect data subject access request (DSAR) requirements. Users querying the graph
      about individuals must see same results that individual would see in DSAR response. Implement DSAR export including
      all relationships where individual is source or target.'
    - 'SOC 2 Type II: Graph query audit logging must capture who accessed what relationships, when, and why (query intent).
      Relationship-level access controls must prevent unauthorized discovery of connections between entities. Include graph
      access monitoring in security incident detection systems.'
    - 'CCPA: When consumers request data deletion, all graph relationships involving that consumer must be removed or anonymized.
      Implement relationship cascade deletion that removes orphaned nodes. Provide compliance reports showing relationship
      cleanup for data subject requests.'
    data_privacy:
    - Graph relationships may reveal sensitive information through inference (e.g., medical conditions inferred from doctor-patient
      relationships). Implement relationship classification scheme marking sensitive relationship types requiring additional
      access controls.
    - Relationship provenance includes document references that must maintain source document permission boundaries. Graph
      query results must never expose relationship evidence from documents user cannot access directly.
    - Graph export and API access must apply same privacy controls as UI. Prevent bulk graph scraping that could aggregate
      private information. Rate limit graph queries and implement complexity scoring to detect reconnaissance attempts.
    security_standards:
    - Graph database must use encryption at rest for all node/edge data and properties. Graph query audit logs encrypted and
      retained per security policy (minimum 90 days).
    - Graph API authentication uses same OAuth 2.0 / JWT tokens as primary application. API keys for service accounts rotated
      every 90 days. Graph queries logged for security monitoring and anomaly detection.
    - 'Implement graph-based anomaly detection for security use cases: detect unusual relationship patterns, identify privilege
      escalation through relationship traversal, monitor access to sensitive entity neighborhoods.'
  notes:
    implementation_considerations:
    - 'Graph database selection: Neo4j offers mature Cypher query language and excellent tooling but higher licensing costs.
      Amazon Neptune provides AWS-native integration and serverless scaling. Consider starting with Neo4j for development
      (rich ecosystem) and evaluating Neptune for production (cost optimization).'
    - 'Real-time vs batch graph updates: Relationship extraction from documents can happen in batch (every 4 hours) for better
      resource utilization. Critical relationships (user mentions, urgent tags) should update graph immediately. Implement
      message queue for graph update events.'
    - 'Graph visualization performance: Rendering 1000+ nodes client-side causes browser performance issues. Implement server-side
      layout computation and progressive rendering. Use WebGL-based renderers (Graphistry, yFiles) for large graphs. Provide
      graph summary statistics instead of full visualization for very large subgraphs.'
    user_experience_priorities:
    - Graph exploration should feel like 'following a conversation' not 'querying a database'. Use animation and smooth transitions
      when expanding nodes. Provide breadcrumb trails showing how user navigated to current view. Support 'back' button and
      browser history for graph navigation.
    - 'Natural language query interface must be forgiving and educational. Show query interpretation before execution. Provide
      query suggestions based on graph schema (e.g., ''You can ask about: dependencies, ownership, timeline''). Build library
      of example queries users can adapt.'
    - Relationship provenance should be one click away. Clicking relationship edge opens sidebar showing all source documents
      mentioning this connection with highlight of relevant excerpts. Users can confirm/reject relationship directly from
      provenance view, feeding back to graph quality.
    future_enhancements:
    - 'Graph-based recommendations: Suggest relevant entities based on user''s current graph exploration context. Recommend
      stakeholders to include in projects based on relationship proximity. Identify experts on topics through graph centrality
      analysis.'
    - 'Temporal graph analysis: Track how relationships change over time. Show relationship timelines (when formed, when last
      active, when dissolved). Identify relationship trends (growing dependencies, emerging collaborations, weakening connections).'
    - 'Multi-tenant graph federation: Organizations want to share subgraphs with partners while maintaining privacy boundaries.
      Implement federated graph queries that traverse across organizational boundaries with permission checks. Support graph
      exports/imports for inter-organizational knowledge sharing.'
    - 'Graph-powered analytics: Provide graph metrics dashboard showing network health (connectivity, clustering, central
      hubs). Identify structural holes (missing connections that should exist). Detect community structures through graph
      clustering algorithms.'

    - Ensure security and compliance
    pain_points:
    - Limited visibility into system operations
    - Manual configuration tasks
    - Difficulty troubleshooting issues
    usage_context: Periodic configuration and monitoring
    technical_proficiency: advanced
    current_situation: As the administrator responsible for managing knowledge graph engine, I face constant challenges with
      system configuration, user support, and operational monitoring. I lack visibility into how the system is being used,
      which makes it difficult to optimize performance or troubleshoot issues. Manual configuration tasks consume significant
      time that could be spent on strategic initiatives. When users encounter problems, I often struggle to diagnose root
      causes quickly. The current management tools feel inadequate for enterprise needs.
    transformation_moment: When comprehensive administrative capabilities were added to knowledge graph engine, my role transformed
      from reactive firefighting to proactive system optimization. I gained real-time visibility into system health, usage
      patterns, and potential issues before they impact users. Configuration tasks that once took hours now take minutes through
      automation and intelligent defaults. Troubleshooting became straightforward with detailed diagnostic tools and audit
      logs. I could finally manage the system strategically instead of just keeping it running.
    emotional_resolution: I feel in control and professionally competent in my administrative role. The stress of unexpected
      failures and user complaints has diminished dramatically because I can prevent problems proactively. I have time to
      focus on strategic improvements like security hardening, performance optimization, and user training instead of constant
      firefighting. My reputation as a reliable administrator has grown, and I can confidently present system metrics to leadership.
      The job is now fulfilling instead of overwhelming.
