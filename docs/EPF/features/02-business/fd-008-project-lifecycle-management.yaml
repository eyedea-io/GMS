  problem_statement: 'Knowledge work projects lack structured lifecycle management, causing teams to reinvent workflows for each initiative. Research shows that knowledge workers spend 15-20% of time on project coordination overhead (status updates, handoffs, approvals) rather than deep work. Without standardized project phases and state transitions, teams struggle with unclear ownership (45% of project delays attributed to "waiting for someone"), inconsistent documentation (60% of projects lack clear acceptance criteria), and poor visibility (managers cannot track project health without scheduled status meetings). This creates coordination friction, delays deliverables by 20-30%, and reduces team productivity. Organizations need structured project lifecycle frameworks that guide teams through standard phases while remaining flexible for different project types.

  '
  market_context: 'Project lifecycle management is a core feature in modern work management platforms, with Linear (issue states), Asana (project phases), and Monday.com (workflow automation) setting market expectations. Organizations expect projects to move through standard phases (Planning → In Progress → Review → Complete) with automated transitions, notifications, and approvals. The trend toward async work (driven by distributed teams) requires lifecycle visibility without synchronous meetings - 70% of knowledge workers want project status visible in tools rather than requiring Slack/email inquiries. Key competitive requirements include: customizable workflows (different project types need different phases), automated transitions (reduce manual status updates by 80%), approval gates (quality control before phase transitions), and retrospective capture (learning from completed projects). Products without lifecycle structure force teams to rely on spreadsheets and wiki pages for tracking, creating data fragmentation and process inconsistency.

  success_metrics:
  - metric: Project coordination overhead time
    target: Reduce from 15-20% to <8% of total project time through automated lifecycle transitions and visibility
    measurement: Time tracking analysis comparing manual coordination tasks (status updates, handoffs, approvals) before/after implementation
  - metric: Project delivery predictability
    target: Increase on-time delivery rate from 60% to 85% through structured phase gates and blocker visibility
    measurement: Project completion analytics tracking planned vs actual delivery dates for projects >2 weeks duration
  - metric: Process adoption rate
    target: Achieve 80% of projects following standard lifecycle phases within 3 months of feature release
    measurement: Product analytics tracking percentage of projects with completed lifecycle metadata vs total active projects
definition:
  job_to_be_done: When teams start knowledge work projects, they want structured lifecycle phases with clear transitions, so they can reduce coordination overhead, improve delivery predictability, and maintain consistent quality standards across all initiatives.
  solution_approach: The platform provides configurable project lifecycle templates defining phases (Planning → Research → Execution → Review → Complete → Archived) with state transitions, approval gates, and automated notifications. Each project follows a lifecycle template (customizable per team/organization) that guides teams through standard workflows while allowing flexibility for project-specific needs. The system automatically tracks phase durations, identifies blockers, and surfaces projects stuck in specific phases. Teams can create custom lifecycle templates for different project types (research, implementation, compliance review) while maintaining consistent reporting across all projects. Retrospectives are captured at project completion to enable continuous improvement.

    name: Lifecycle Template Library
    description: 'Create and manage reusable lifecycle templates defining project phases, state transitions, and approval requirements. Built-in templates include: Standard (Planning → Execution → Review → Complete), Research (Discovery → Analysis → Synthesis → Report), Compliance (Request → Review → Approval → Implementation → Audit), and Sprint (Backlog → In Progress → Testing → Done). Each template defines: phase names, required fields per phase (e.g., Planning requires objectives and success criteria), automatic transitions vs manual gates, approval workflows (who must approve phase transitions), and time-boxing recommendations (Planning: 1-3 days, Execution: 1-4 weeks). Organizations can clone built-in templates and customize for specific needs. Templates are versioned - updating a template does not affect in-flight projects unless explicitly migrated.

  scenarios:
  - id: scn-001
    name: Project Manager Creates New Project with Standard Lifecycle
    actor: Project Manager (Team Member with project creation permissions) initiates new knowledge work project requiring structured lifecycle management
    context: The Project Manager needs to start a new product research project that will involve multiple team members over 3-4 weeks. They want to use the standard Research lifecycle template (Discovery → Analysis → Synthesis → Report) to ensure the team follows consistent phases and captures all required artifacts. Without structured lifecycle, previous research projects lacked clear phase transitions and resulted in incomplete documentation. The Manager accesses the project creation flow from the team workspace dashboard.
    trigger: Project Manager clicks "New Project" button from team dashboard and selects "Research Project" template
    action: |-
      Project Manager completes project creation workflow in these steps:
      1) Enter project metadata: name "Q1 Market Analysis", description, expected duration (4 weeks), team members (5 people). System validates inputs and checks member permissions.
      2) Select lifecycle template from dropdown: "Research Project" template with phases (Discovery → Analysis → Synthesis → Report). System displays template preview showing phase names and recommended durations.
      3) Customize phase durations if needed: Accept default Discovery (1 week), Analysis (1 week), Synthesis (1 week), Report (3 days). System calculates expected completion date.
      4) Define exit criteria for first phase (Discovery): Add required deliverables "Research questions documented, Data sources identified". System saves criteria as checklist items.
      5) Assign project owner (self) and designate approvers for phase transitions (Team Lead). System validates approver permissions.
      6) Review and submit. System creates project, sends notifications to all members and approvers, and sets initial phase to "Discovery".
    outcome: Project created successfully with Research lifecycle template applied. All 5 team members receive notification with project details and first phase (Discovery) requirements. Project appears on team dashboard in Discovery phase section. Project owner sees exit criteria checklist for Discovery phase. Approver (Team Lead) receives notification of approval responsibilities. Team can now begin Discovery phase with clear understanding of phase goals, expected duration (1 week), and exit criteria. System will monitor phase duration and notify team if Discovery exceeds recommended 1 week timeframe.
    acceptance_criteria:
    - Project created with all metadata fields populated (name, description, team members, durations)
    - Research lifecycle template applied with 4 phases visible in project timeline
    - Discovery phase is active with exit criteria checklist showing 2 required items
    - All 5 team members receive project notification within 1 minute of creation
    - Project appears in "Discovery Phase" section of team dashboard
    - Team Lead listed as approver for all phase transitions with notification sent

    name: Project Team Encounters Blocker and Escalates for Resolution
    actor: Project Team Member (Contributor) identifies critical blocker preventing project progress during Execution phase
    context: The project is in Execution phase (day 8 of recommended 14 days) when team member discovers a critical dependency on external API that is not yet available. Without this API, the implementation cannot proceed and project will miss its completion target. Team member needs to formally document this blocker, assign severity, and notify stakeholders so appropriate action can be taken (delay project, find workaround, escalate to external team). Previous blocker communication via Slack resulted in lost context and unclear ownership.
    trigger: Team member encounters technical blocker during implementation work and decides to formally document it in the project system
    action: |-
      Team member creates and escalates blocker through these steps:
      1) Access project detail view showing lifecycle timeline and current phase (Execution, day 8 of 14).
      2) Click "Add Blocker" button opening blocker creation form. System pre-fills current phase (Execution) and requestor identity.
      3) Fill blocker details: Type = "External Dependency", Severity = "Critical", Description = "Implementation blocked waiting for Partner API v2 which launches in 2 weeks (Feb 15). Current API lacks required authentication endpoints. Cannot proceed with integration without this API." System validates required fields.
      4) Set estimated resolution timeframe: 14 days (based on partner's launch date). System calculates impact on project completion date (will exceed phase duration by 1 week).
      5) Assign blocker owner: External Relations Manager (person responsible for partner relationship). System sends notification to owner.
      6) Link related documentation: Partner API roadmap URL, internal integration requirements doc. System attaches as reference links.
      7) Submit blocker. System creates blocker record, notifies project owner + blocker owner + approvers, updates project health status to Yellow (critical blocker detected), and schedules automatic escalation if unresolved in 3 days.
    outcome: "Blocker documented with full context and assigned to appropriate owner (External Relations Manager). All stakeholders notified immediately - project owner sees blocker in project view, External Relations Manager receives ownership assignment, Team Lead (approver) gets awareness notification. Project health status changes from Green to Yellow due to critical blocker, triggering visibility on team dashboard. System schedules escalation - if blocker unresolved in 3 days (Jan 21) notify project owner, if unresolved in 7 days (Jan 25) notify Team Lead, if unresolved in 14 days (Feb 1) notify Organization Admin. External Relations Manager can now coordinate with partner to potentially accelerate API launch or team can explore workaround solutions. Project timeline automatically adjusted showing expected delay if blocker not resolved by estimated date. Team has clear visibility into blocker status and ownership preventing lost blocker syndrome."
    acceptance_criteria:
    - Blocker created with all required fields (type, severity, description, estimated resolution, owner)
    - Project health status changes from Green to Yellow within 5 seconds of blocker creation
    - Notifications sent to 3 stakeholders (project owner, blocker owner, approver) within 1 minute
    - Project appears in "Projects with Critical Blockers" section of team dashboard
    - Escalation schedule visible showing automatic notifications at 3, 7, and 14 days if unresolved
    - Project timeline updated showing potential 1-week delay if blocker not resolved by estimated date

    name: Project Completes with Retrospective Capture
    actor: Project Owner (Project Manager) facilitates retrospective after project reaches completion phase following successful delivery
    context: The research project has completed all phases (Discovery → Analysis → Synthesis → Report) and delivered final report to stakeholders. Total project duration was 5 weeks (1 week longer than original 4-week estimate) due to external API blocker encountered mid-project. Project Owner wants to capture team learnings while context is fresh - what went well (strong collaboration, clear phase goals), what could improve (earlier dependency identification, better time estimates), and action items for future projects. The system prompts for retrospective when project enters Complete phase.
    trigger: Project Owner transitions project to Complete phase and receives system prompt to conduct retrospective within 3 days
    action: |-
      Project Owner facilitates and documents retrospective through these steps:
      1) Schedule retrospective meeting with all 5 team members for 60-minute session. Send meeting invite with agenda (review project timeline, discuss what worked/didn't work, identify action items).
      2) Conduct retrospective meeting using structured format. Team discusses: What worked well (clear phase exit criteria, strong async collaboration via comments), What could improve (dependency identification happened too late, initial time estimates too optimistic), Action items (create dependency checklist for Discovery phase, add buffer time to estimates).
      3) After meeting, access project detail view and click "Complete Retrospective" button. System opens retrospective capture interface pre-filled with project summary.
      4) Document "What Worked Well" section: Enter 3 key points from team discussion with details (clear phase exit criteria helped team stay aligned, async collaboration via project comments reduced meeting overhead, Research template phases matched actual workflow well).
      5) Document "What Could Improve" section: Enter 3 improvement areas (External dependency identification should happen in Discovery phase not Execution, Initial time estimates were 20% too optimistic need to add buffer, Blocker escalation process worked well but could be faster with auto-assignment rules).
      6) Add action items with owners: (1) Create dependency checklist template for Discovery phase - Owner: Project Owner, (2) Update Research template to include +20% time buffer - Owner: Team Lead, (3) Configure auto-assignment rules for blocker types - Owner: System Admin. System creates linked tasks for each action item.
      7) Tag common themes from dropdown: select "Dependencies", "Estimation", "Templates". System uses tags for cross-project retrospective analysis.
      8) Submit retrospective. System saves retrospective data, transitions project to Archived phase, sends summary to all team members, and makes retrospective searchable for future project planning.
    outcome: Retrospective captured with structured learnings from 5-week project. All 3 sections documented with specific examples and context. Three action items created as trackable tasks with assigned owners preventing learnings from being lost. Project transitioned to Archived phase removing it from active dashboard but keeping all data accessible. Team members receive retrospective summary email within minutes of submission. Action item owners receive task notifications. Retrospective data becomes available in organizational learning dashboard - other teams can search retrospectives tagged with "Dependencies" or "Research" to learn from this project's experiences. Team Lead can review action item (update Research template buffer) and implement improvement for all future research projects. The dependency checklist action will directly address root cause of delay (late dependency identification) improving future project predictability. System tracks that this project had 1 critical blocker causing 1-week delay - this data feeds into team/organization metrics for process improvement prioritization.

    description: Mid-level knowledge worker responsible for coordinating team projects from initiation through completion. Manages 3-5 concurrent projects involving 3-8 team members each. Needs structured workflows to reduce coordination overhead and ensure consistent delivery quality across all projects.
    goals:
    - Reduce time spent on project coordination (status updates, handoffs, approvals) from 20% to <10% of total work time
    - Improve project delivery predictability by identifying and addressing blockers proactively before they cause delays
    - Ensure consistent project documentation and learnings capture for continuous team improvement
    - Provide stakeholders with real-time project visibility without requiring frequent status meetings
    pain_points:
    - Spends 8-10 hours per week in status update meetings that could be eliminated with better visibility tools
    - Project blockers often discovered late causing timeline delays and team frustration
    - Inconsistent project documentation makes it difficult to learn from past projects or onboard new team members
    - Lack of structured phase transitions leads to scope creep and unclear completion criteria
    usage_context: Daily active user managing active project portfolio, weekly usage for project initiation and retrospectives. Primary user of project dashboard and lifecycle management features.
    technical_proficiency: intermediate
    current_situation: "As a Project Manager coordinating multiple knowledge work projects, I currently spend 15-20% of my time on coordination overhead - sending status update requests via Slack, scheduling alignment meetings, tracking down blocker owners, and manually documenting project phases in wikis. I manage 4 active projects right now: a product research initiative (3 weeks in, seems stuck in analysis phase but unclear why), a compliance review (waiting on legal approval for 2 weeks with no visibility into approval status), a process documentation effort (just started, team unclear on success criteria), and a technical integration (blocked on external API but blocker communication lost in Slack threads). Each project uses slightly different workflows because we lack standardized lifecycle templates - the research team likes agile sprints, legal wants waterfall approvals, documentation team uses kanban. This inconsistency makes it impossible for me to get portfolio-level visibility or identify systemic issues affecting multiple projects. I've tried using spreadsheets for project tracking but they quickly become outdated because team members don't update them. Status meetings consume 8 hours of my week (2 hours per major project) and even then I don't have confidence in the information - people say 'on track' but I discover blockers weeks later. When projects complete, we rarely capture retrospectives because there's no structured place to document learnings, so we repeat the same mistakes across projects. I know there must be a better way to coordinate projects that doesn't require me to be the central hub for all status information."
    transformation_moment: "When I gained access to structured project lifecycle management with automated phase transitions and blocker tracking, my coordination overhead dropped dramatically within the first month. I created lifecycle templates for our three common project types (Research, Compliance, Documentation) defining standard phases and exit criteria for each. Now when I start a new project, I select the appropriate template and the system guides the team through phases automatically. The first major win came when our research project hit a blocker (external dependency) - instead of the blocker getting lost in Slack, the team member documented it in the project system with severity and owner assignment. The system automatically escalated when the blocker hit 3 days unresolved, notifying me and the external team lead. We resolved it in 24 hours instead of the usual 2-week discovery delay. I stopped scheduling weekly status meetings for two projects because the lifecycle dashboard gave me real-time visibility - I could see at a glance which projects were in which phases, health status, and blocker counts. When stakeholders asked for updates, I just shared the dashboard link instead of writing status reports. The biggest transformation came from retrospective capture at project completion - we now have 8 completed project retrospectives documenting what worked and what didn't. I discovered that dependency identification was a recurring issue across 5 of those projects, so I added a dependency checklist to our Discovery phase template. That single improvement has reduced mid-project surprises by an estimated 60%. My coordination time is now 4-6 hours per week instead of 12-15 hours, and I'm managing 5 projects instead of 4 with less stress. Teams appreciate the clarity of phase-based workflows and I appreciate sleeping better knowing I have visibility into project health."
    emotional_resolution: "I now feel confident and in control managing my project portfolio instead of constantly reactive and stressed about unknown project status. The structured lifecycle templates give my teams clear guidance reducing the 'what should we do next' questions that used to interrupt my deep work 5-10 times per day. I trust that blocker escalation automation will surface issues before they become emergencies - I'm no longer the single point of failure for project coordination. When stakeholders ask about project status, I confidently share the dashboard knowing the data is current and accurate, rather than scrambling to gather updates across multiple Slack channels and wikis. Retrospectives have created a culture of continuous improvement on my teams - we're learning from each project and systematically fixing recurring issues rather than accepting them as inevitable. I've reclaimed 6-8 hours per week that I now invest in strategic planning and skill development instead of coordination overhead. Most importantly, my team members report higher satisfaction because they have clarity on project goals and phases - they know what success looks like and can work autonomously without constant check-ins. I've gone from feeling like a project traffic controller to feeling like a strategic enabler, and that shift has made my role far more fulfilling and impactful."

    description: Knowledge worker executing project tasks as part of multi-person team projects. Works on 2-3 concurrent projects with varying coordination requirements. Needs clarity on project phases, what's expected at each stage, and how to communicate blockers effectively.
    goals:
    - Understand current project phase and what deliverables are expected without requiring manager explanation
    - Document blockers effectively so they get resolved quickly without lost context or unclear ownership
    - Spend <5% of work time on status updates and coordination meetings
    - Access project context and history quickly when returning to project after breaks
    pain_points:
    - Unclear what phase projects are in or what success looks like causing wasted effort on wrong priorities
    - Blockers communicated via Slack get lost or lack follow-up leading to frustrating delays
    - Frequent status update meetings interrupt deep work without providing value to individual contributors
    - Switching between projects requires hunting through Slack/wiki/docs to rebuild context wasting 15-30 minutes per switch
    usage_context: Daily usage when actively working on project phases. Primary interactions are viewing project status, adding blockers, and completing phase requirements. Weekly retrospective participation when projects complete.
    technical_proficiency: intermediate
    current_situation: "As a knowledge worker contributing to multiple team projects simultaneously, I struggle with understanding where each project stands and what I should be working on. Right now I'm on three projects: a research analysis (I think we're done with data collection but unclear if we're in analysis phase or still gathering sources), a documentation rewrite (manager asked for outline last week but I don't know if that's blocking anything), and a compliance review (seems to be waiting on approvals but I don't know from whom or for how long). Each project has different coordination styles - research team uses Google Docs with comments, documentation uses wiki pages, compliance has a Slack channel. When I need context about project status, I have to read through Slack history or ask the manager directly, which feels inefficient and interrupts their work. Last month I encountered a blocker on the research project - a data source required paid access that our team doesn't have. I mentioned it in Slack but got no response for 10 days. Turned out the message was buried under other discussion and the person who could approve the purchase never saw it. By the time we resolved it, I'd wasted hours trying workarounds that didn't work. Status update meetings are frustrating - I attend 3 per week (1 hour each) but mostly listen to others' updates that don't affect my work. When asked for my status, I give the standard 'on track' because I don't want to slow down the meeting, even when I have concerns. There's no structured place to raise blockers in meetings and interrupting feels awkward. When projects complete, we sometimes have retrospective meetings but no one documents the learnings, so 3 months later when we start a similar project, we've forgotten what we learned and repeat mistakes."
    transformation_moment: "When our team adopted structured lifecycle management, the immediate difference was clarity about project phases and expectations. Each project now shows a visual timeline indicating current phase (e.g., 'Analysis - Day 6 of 10 recommended') with a checklist of exit criteria (e.g., 'Data sources documented', 'Analysis framework selected'). I can see at a glance what's expected and whether I'm on track without asking the manager. The blocker documentation system transformed how I communicate issues - instead of Slack messages that get lost, I now create formal blocker entries with type (External Dependency), severity (High), description, and estimated resolution time. When I documented a blocker about missing API access, the system automatically notified the project manager and assigned the blocker to our IT admin. I got an update within 4 hours instead of 10 days, and the blocker had a clear owner and resolution timeline. I stopped attending 2 of my 3 weekly status meetings because managers can see project status in the dashboard - we only meet now when there are decision points or complex discussions needed. That freed up 2 hours per week for focused work. The lifecycle transitions also provide natural context boundaries - when I return to a project after a week away, I see 'Moved to Synthesis phase 3 days ago' with clear transition notes, immediately orienting me without needing to read through days of Slack history. When our research project completed, the retrospective capture was built into the workflow - we spent 45 minutes as a team documenting what worked (clear data collection criteria) and what didn't (late discovery of data access requirements). Those learnings are now visible when anyone starts a new research project, creating organizational memory instead of repeating mistakes."
    emotional_resolution: "I now feel autonomous and informed rather than constantly seeking manager guidance about project status and expectations. The phase-based structure gives me confidence that I'm working on the right things at the right time - I can see exit criteria and self-direct my work instead of waiting for instructions. When I encounter blockers, I document them immediately with confidence they'll be tracked and resolved rather than sending Slack messages and hoping someone notices. I've reclaimed 2-3 hours per week previously spent in unnecessary status meetings, reinvesting that time into deep work and skill development. Context switching between projects is much faster - instead of 20-minute hunts through Slack and docs, I spend 2 minutes reviewing the project timeline and current phase to understand where things stand. I appreciate that retrospectives are now a standard part of project completion with documented learnings - I can see what other teams learned from similar projects and avoid their mistakes. I feel more engaged and productive because I understand the bigger picture of project phases and my contributions are clearly tied to phase progression rather than feeling like isolated tasks with unclear purpose."

    - Approval requests come via Slack/email with insufficient context requiring lengthy back-and-forth before decision
    - Valuable learnings from completed projects lost because no systematic retrospective capture and analysis
    usage_context: Weekly usage for portfolio review, template management, and retrospective analysis. Daily usage during high-project-volume periods for approval processing and blocker escalation handling.
    technical_proficiency: advanced
    current_situation: "As a team lead managing 12 team members and 10 active projects, I lack visibility into portfolio health and struggle to identify patterns affecting team effectiveness. Each project manager uses their own coordination approach - some use agile sprints, others use ad-hoc task lists, a few use waterfall phases. This inconsistency makes it impossible to compare project health or resource allocation across projects. I discover issues reactively when projects miss deadlines rather than proactively through early warning signals. Last quarter, three separate projects were delayed by external API dependencies, but I only realized it was a pattern after the third delay - if I'd seen the pattern after the first or second occurrence, I could have negotiated different API SLAs with the external team. I'm a bottleneck for approvals because project managers Slack me approval requests with minimal context ('Can we move to Execution phase?') requiring 3-5 follow-up questions before I have enough information to decide. This creates delays (requests sit for 2-3 days while I gather context) and frustration (PMs feel blocked, I feel overwhelmed). We occasionally run retrospectives after major projects but learnings are captured in Google Docs that no one reads afterward. I've noticed teams repeating the same mistakes (late dependency identification, optimistic time estimates, poor requirements documentation) but I lack tools to surface these patterns and drive systematic improvements. I spend 6-8 hours per week in individual project status meetings trying to maintain awareness, but that doesn't scale as the team grows. I need portfolio-level visibility tools and data-driven process improvement approaches rather than relying on my memory and spreadsheet tracking."
    transformation_moment: "When I implemented structured lifecycle management for my team, the first major improvement was portfolio visibility through the lifecycle dashboard. I could finally see all 10 projects organized by phase with health indicators - 4 in Execution (2 green, 2 yellow), 3 in Planning (all green), 2 in Review (1 with overdue approval), 1 stuck in Discovery for 3 weeks (red flag). That stuck project had 2 critical blockers aged 15+ days, immediately signaling needed intervention. I created three standard lifecycle templates (Research, Implementation, Compliance) defining phases, exit criteria, and approval gates for our most common project types. Within 2 weeks, 8 of 10 projects had adopted templates, dramatically improving consistency. The approval workflow transformation was huge - instead of Slack requests with no context, I now receive structured approval requests showing: project name, current phase, exit criteria completion status, phase duration vs template recommendation, blocker count, and requestor justification. I can approve or reject with full context in 2 minutes instead of 20 minutes of follow-up questions. Approval queue depth visibility helps me prioritize - when 5 projects are awaiting approval, that's a signal I need to delegate some approvals to project managers. The blocker aggregation revealed patterns I'd suspected but couldn't prove - over 6 weeks, 4 projects flagged external API dependencies as blockers, each with 7-14 day delays. With data showing 30+ days of cumulative project delay from API dependencies, I had justification to escalate to our external relations team for SLA improvements. Retrospective analysis has been transformative - we now have 12 completed project retrospectives tagged by themes. I searched for 'Dependencies' tag and found 8 projects mentioning late dependency identification. That data justified creating a mandatory dependency checklist for all Discovery phases, which has reduced mid-project dependency surprises by ~60% based on recent projects."
    emotional_resolution: "I now feel like a strategic team leader using data to drive improvements rather than a reactive coordinator fighting fires. The portfolio dashboard gives me confidence that I have real-time awareness of team project health - I'm no longer surprised by project delays because warning signals (stuck in phase, critical blockers, overdue approvals) surface automatically. I can spend my 1-on-1 time with project managers discussing strategic project decisions and team development rather than gathering basic status information. The approval workflow efficiency has eliminated my guilt about being a bottleneck - requests are processed within 24 hours instead of 3-5 days, and I have sufficient context to make quality decisions quickly. Retrospective data has shifted our team culture from repeating mistakes to systematic improvement - when we encounter recurring issues, we can quickly check if other projects faced the same problem and learn from their solutions. I've reduced my status meeting overhead from 8 hours to 2 hours per week while having better portfolio awareness than ever before. Most importantly, I can demonstrate to leadership that our team is improving velocity and quality over time using retrospective trends and blocker resolution metrics rather than anecdotal evidence. I feel empowered to advocate for my team's needs (like API SLA improvements) using concrete data showing project impact."

    name: Executive Stakeholder
    role: Organization Administrator
    description: Senior leader responsible for org-level strategy and resource allocation across multiple teams. Reviews portfolio of 30-50 projects quarterly to assess strategic progress and identify organizational capability gaps. Needs high-level visibility without tactical project details.
    goals:
    - Understand portfolio health and strategic progress toward organizational objectives at quarterly business reviews
    - Identify organizational capability gaps (recurring blocker patterns, resource constraints) requiring executive intervention
    - Assess team effectiveness and process maturity for resource allocation and investment decisions
    - Validate that project outcomes align with strategic priorities and adjust resource allocation accordingly
    pain_points:
    - Lack portfolio-level visibility requiring manual aggregation of project data from multiple teams for quarterly reviews
    - Cannot identify systemic organizational issues (resource constraints, process gaps) until they cause major project failures
    - Difficult to assess ROI of process improvement investments without data on project delivery predictability trends
    - Strategic initiatives lack clear progress tracking making it hard to know if organization is executing on priorities
    usage_context: Monthly portfolio reviews and quarterly strategic planning. Infrequent direct interaction with project details but needs aggregated analytics and trend reporting.
    technical_proficiency: basic
    current_situation: "As an executive overseeing 4 teams (50 people, 30-40 active projects), I lack visibility into whether our organization is effectively executing strategic priorities. Quarterly business reviews require my team leads to manually compile project status spreadsheets aggregating data from individual project trackers, Slack channels, and meeting notes. This process takes 5-8 hours per team lead and results in data that's 2-4 weeks stale by the time I review it. I can see project counts by status (15 in progress, 8 completed this quarter, 3 delayed) but lack insight into why projects succeed or fail. Last quarter we missed our strategic goal to launch 3 new product features - we launched 2, and the third was delayed 6 weeks. Post-mortems revealed that 2 of the 3 projects encountered external dependency issues, but I had no early warning that dependencies were a systemic risk. If I'd known after the first occurrence, I could have allocated resources or escalated to partners earlier. I cannot assess whether our process improvement investments are working - we hired a project management consultant last year recommending structured workflows, but I have no data showing whether project delivery predictability has improved. When team leads request additional headcount or tooling, I struggle to evaluate requests objectively without metrics showing current team capacity utilization or common blocker categories. Strategic initiatives (like 'improve product quality' or 'accelerate time to market') lack concrete progress tracking - I rely on team leads saying 'on track' but that's subjective and often optimistic. I need portfolio-level analytics showing: project health trends, common delay causes, delivery predictability over time, strategic initiative progress, and organizational capability gaps requiring executive attention."
    transformation_moment: "When I implemented structured lifecycle management across our organization's portfolio, the transformation began with the first quarterly business review using portfolio analytics instead of manually compiled spreadsheets. Team leads no longer spent 5-8 hours gathering data - they simply shared the portfolio dashboard showing real-time project distribution across lifecycle phases with health indicators. I could immediately see patterns that were invisible before - 40% of project delays attributed to external dependencies (previously hidden in narrative post-mortems), Team C's average blocker resolution taking 14 days vs Team A's 6 days (signal for targeted process support), and our on-time delivery improving from 62% to 78% over two quarters (validation that process investments were working). The first major decision enabled by this data came when a team lead requested 3 additional headcount citing 'too many projects'. Using phase duration and blocker data, I discovered the team wasn't under-resourced but rather had systemic process issues - their Discovery phase averaged 2.5x longer than other teams due to repeated requirement gathering cycles. Instead of adding headcount ($450k annual cost), I invested in requirements definition training and a Discovery phase checklist ($15k). Within one quarter, their Discovery phase durations normalized and throughput increased by 35% without additional people. The retrospective analysis capability provided the most profound shift - with 50+ completed project retrospectives tagged and searchable, I could identify organizational capability gaps systematically. Searching retrospectives tagged 'Dependencies' revealed that external dependencies caused delays in 18 of 50 projects, with 8 specifically mentioning our partner API reliability. This data justified a $200k investment in API redundancy and alternative integrations that has since prevented an estimated 12 weeks of cumulative project delays per quarter. When presenting to the board, I replaced anecdotal project updates with data-driven portfolio metrics showing delivery predictability trends, common organizational risks, and ROI of process investments. Board members responded positively to the analytical rigor - one board member commented 'This is the first time I've seen execution health communicated with this level of clarity and evidence.' That credibility opened doors for a larger strategic investment approval ($2M) that would have been questioned without solid execution metrics backing our capability."
    emotional_resolution: "I now feel confident in organizational execution visibility and data-driven resource allocation rather than relying on subjective team lead reports and gut instinct. The portfolio analytics dashboard gives me immediate answers to strategic questions: Are we delivering projects on time? (78% on-time delivery last quarter, up from 62% previous quarter - process improvements working). What are our biggest organizational risks? (External dependencies cause 40% of project delays - time to invest in alternative solutions). Which teams are most effective? (Team A: 85% on-time delivery with 6-day average blocker resolution vs Team C: 65% on-time with 14-day resolution - signal that Team C needs process support or resources). Retrospective trend analysis provides objective ROI validation for process investments - after implementing structured lifecycles, our average project delay decreased from 2.1 weeks to 0.8 weeks (saving ~65 person-weeks per quarter across portfolio). When team leads request resources, I can now evaluate objectively using blocker data and phase duration metrics rather than subjective arguments. Strategic initiatives have concrete tracking - our 'accelerate time to market' initiative shows measurable progress through decreased average project duration (from 6.2 weeks to 4.8 weeks over 6 months). I spend less time in tactical project reviews and more time on strategic decisions because I trust the portfolio visibility tools to surface issues needing executive attention. Most importantly, I can confidently communicate organizational execution health to board members and investors using data-driven metrics and trends rather than anecdotal examples. This credibility has increased board confidence in our execution capability and opened doors for larger strategic investments."

boundaries:
  non_goals:
  - Real-time resource allocation across projects - Current scope focuses on individual project lifecycle management, not portfolio-level resource optimization. Team leads manually allocate people to projects based on availability and skills. Automated resource balancing (moving people between projects based on phase requirements) would require workforce planning integration adding 40+ engineering days. Manual allocation sufficient for MVP targeting teams <50 people.
  - Gantt chart / timeline visualization - Lifecycle phase timelines are represented as linear progressions with duration metrics, not interactive Gantt charts with task dependencies and date ranges. Gantt charts require significant UI complexity (drag-drop date adjustment, task dependency lines, critical path calculation) adding 20-30 engineering days for use case affecting <15% of users. Phase-based timeline visualization sufficient for MVP.
  - Integration with external project management tools (Jira, Asana, Monday) - Feature manages projects natively within platform, no bi-directional sync with external PM tools. External tool integration would require API development, field mapping, conflict resolution, adding 50+ engineering days. Organizations can migrate to native lifecycle management or continue using external tools separately. Integration may be considered in v2.0 if demand justifies complexity.
  - Financial tracking and budget management per project - Scope limited to workflow and health tracking, not financial metrics (project costs, budget burn rate, ROI calculation). Financial tracking requires accounting system integration, currency handling, cost allocation rules adding 30-40 engineering days for use case relevant to <10% of projects. Organizations can track project finances in separate systems (ERP, spreadsheets) while using lifecycle management for workflow coordination.
  constraints:
  - Technical - Retrospective data retention limited to 2 years for compliance with data retention policies. Older retrospectives automatically archived to cold storage (not searchable through UI, requires admin data export). Affects long-running organizations with >2 years of project history but necessary for GDPR compliance and storage cost management.
  - Business - MVP timeline is 4 months limiting implementation to core lifecycle phases and blocker management. Advanced features (custom field types in lifecycle templates, AI-powered blocker categorization, project portfolio scenario planning) deferred to v2.0. May require manual workarounds for edge cases not covered by standard templates until v2.0.
  - Regulatory - Audit trail of all phase transitions and approvals must be immutable and retained for 7 years for SOX compliance. Adds database storage overhead (~5KB per phase transition) and requires write-once audit table design. Applies only to organizations subject to SOX regulations but implemented platform-wide for consistency.
  - Third-party - Project health scoring algorithm uses proprietary formulas that may not match organization-specific definitions of project health. Organizations can view underlying metrics (phase duration, blocker count) and define custom thresholds but cannot fully customize health calculation logic without engineering support. Affects ~5% of organizations with highly specific project health requirements.
