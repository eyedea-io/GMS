# EPF v1.13.0 - Calibration Memo Template
# This document records the team's final decision for the cycle.
# It's a collaborative artifact created by the team and the AI Knowledge Agent.
# It determines the direction for the next READY phase (INSIGHT → STRATEGY → ROADMAP).

# Strategic Decision
decision: "pending_assessment" # persevere, pivot, pull_the_plug
confidence: "medium" # low, medium, high

# Decision Reasoning
reasoning: "The cycle has not yet concluded. This memo will be populated after the assessment_report is complete and the team has discussed the findings."
