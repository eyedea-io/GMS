# EPF v1.13.0 - Roadmap Recipe Template
# ROADMAP Phase: Recipe for Solution
# This is the third sub-phase of READY where we create the actionable plan.
# 
# EPF v1.9.6 BREAKING CHANGE: Work packages removed from EPF.
# EPF now defines: Objectives → Key Results → Feature Definitions
# Spec-driven tools own: Work Packages → Tasks
#
# STRUCTURE: The roadmap is organized by TRACKS (Product, Strategy, Org/Ops, Commercial)
# to align with the four value models in the FIRE phase. Each track has its own OKRs,
# assumptions, and solution scaffold. Feature definitions (in FIRE phase) translate
# KR intent into capabilities that spec-driven tools consume.
#
# ============================================================================
# TRL FIELDS (Technology Readiness Levels) - When to add them
# ============================================================================
# Add TRL fields to Key Results when tracking innovation maturity progression:
# 1. Proving technical feasibility of novel approaches (TRL 2-7)
# 2. Tracking technical maturity progression in product development
# 3. Documenting learning and experimental validation
# 4. Distinguishing innovation work (TRL 1-6) from execution (TRL 7-9)
#
# TRL fields are OPTIONAL - only add when you need to:
# - Track learning and uncertainty resolution
# - Document innovation maturity advancement
# - Provide evidence of systematic experimentation
#
# The Pathfinder wizard can enrich existing roadmaps with TRL fields
# using Mode B (Roadmap Enrichment). See examples in Product Track below.
