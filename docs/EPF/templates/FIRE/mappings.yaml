# EPF v1.13.0 - Mappings Template
# This document creates a traceable link between the abstract value model and concrete implementation artifacts.
# It is populated during the FIRE phase by the engineering team.
# It ensures that every piece of code, design, or documentation has a clear purpose and can be traced back to the value it's intended to create.
