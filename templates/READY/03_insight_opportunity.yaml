# EPF v1.13.0 - Insight Opportunity Template
# INSIGHT Phase: Big Opportunity Identification
# This is the first sub-phase of READY where we identify and validate a significant market/user opportunity.
# This document synthesizes insights from 01_insight_analyses.yaml into a clear opportunity statement.
# This opportunity must align with organizational North Star (00_north_star.yaml) and will inform:
# - Strategic foundations (02_strategy_foundations.yaml)
# - Strategy formula (04_strategy_formula.yaml)
#
# Related Resources:
# - Schema: ../../schemas/insight_opportunity_schema.json
