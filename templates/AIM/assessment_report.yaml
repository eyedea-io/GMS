# EPF v1.13.0 - Assessment Report Template
# Assessment Report (AIM Phase)
# This document is generated by the Synthesizer AI agent at the end of a cycle.
# It provides a data-driven assessment of performance against the OKRs and Key Results
# defined in 05_roadmap_recipe.yaml.
#
# NOTE: Assessments focus on OKR/KR-level outcomes and assumption validation.
# Work package outcomes are tracked in spec-driven development tools.
# Key Results are the "meta work package" - the measurable milestones that matter strategically.
